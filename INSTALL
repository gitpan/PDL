To install PerlDL on your machine, first check that you have
a high enough version of Perl. 5.003_26 should be enough for now.

Then, just say

	perl Makefile.PL

in the directory this file is in and if that goes ok, say

	make

If there are any strange error messages, please contact the developers
with a full bug report; response is often rapid (we really like to have
PDL work right out of the box on as many platforms as possible).

If make worked correctly, try

	make test

to run the regression tests. Again, if there are errors, please contact
the developers (in the alpha versions, there are some tests with
dataflow that do not yet work. We know about these (in magic.t and
flow.t).
