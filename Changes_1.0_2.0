	PDL Changes between 1.0 and 2.0

This file is an attempt to list the major user-visible changes
between PDL versions 1.0 and 2.0.

 - Piddles are not hashes any more: 

 	$a = zeroes 10,10;
	$$a{FOO} = "bar"

   doesn't work. They are currently scalar references (to opaque
   C structures in finer terms) because of speed as well as
   syntactic issues. If you want to have a hash, use

   	$a->hdr

   which returns a reference to an anonymous hash. (XXX)
