Cephes lib config
-----------------

I leave the default as -DUNK (mconf.h). This is
OK as all it means is that the important constants are in
floating point format rather than binary hex.
The only advantage of the latter is that it is exact, however
we prefer portability to exactly the same numbers at the
epsilon level. (After all PDL also uses system routines).

We can ignore the comments about BIGENDIAN - it is not used
in any of the .c files we have taken from cephes, **AT LEAST
SO FAR**.

The PP code includes protos.h whether or not the system
routines are used. Since the prototypes for system
and cephes versions should be the same this is not a big
deal.
