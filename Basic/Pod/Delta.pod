=head1 NAME

pdldelta - PDL changes between V1.0 and V2.0


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is an attempt to list the major user-visible changes
between PDL versions 1.0 and 2.0.


=head1 Core Changes

=head2 Piddles are not hashes any more: 

    $a = zeroes 10,10;
    $$a{FOO} = "bar"

doesn't work. They are currently scalar references (to opaque
C structures in finer terms) because of speed as well as
syntactic issues. If you want to have a hash, use

    $a->hdr()

which returns a reference to an anonymous hash. (XXX)


=head1 Documentation Changes

Many of the base and library pods were updated.  These
new pods are included in section 1 and section 3:
