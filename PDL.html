DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The perlDL concept is to give standard perl5 the ability to COMPACTLY
store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data sets which
are the bread and butter of scientific computing. e.g. <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>=<STRONG>$b</STRONG>+<STRONG>$c</STRONG></CODE> can
add two 2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.
<p>It is hoped to eventually provide tons of useful functionality for
scientific and numeric analysis.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="PDL_introduction_0">
Introduction</A>
</H2>
The fundamental perl data structures are scalar variables, e.g. <CODE><STRONG>$x</STRONG></CODE>,
which can hold numbers or strings, lists or arrays of scalars, e.g. <CODE><STRONG>@x</STRONG></CODE>,
and associative arrays/hashes of scalars, e.g. <CODE><STRONG>%x</STRONG></CODE>.
<p>perl v5 introduces to perl data structures and objects. A simple
scalar variable <CODE><STRONG>$x</STRONG></CODE> now be a user-defined data type or full blown
object*.
<p>The fundamental idea behind perlDL is to allow <STRONG>$x</STRONG> to hold a whole 1D
spectrum, or a 2D image, a 3D data cube, and so on up to large
N-dimensional data sets. These can be manipulated all at once, e.g.
<CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG> = <STRONG>$b</STRONG> + 2</CODE> does a vector operation on each value in the
spectrum/image/etc.
<p>You may well ask: "Why not just store a spectrum as a simple perl <CODE><STRONG>@x</STRONG></CODE>
style list with each pixel being a list item?"  The two key answers to
this are MEMORY and SPEED.  Because we know our spectrum consists of
pure numbers we can compactly store them in a single block of memory
corresponding to a C style numeric array. This takes up a LOT less
memory than the equivalent perl list. It is then easy to pass this
block of memory to a fast addition routine, or to any other C function
which deals with arrays.  As a result perlDL is very fast --- for example
one can mulitiply a 2048*2048 image in exactly the same time as it
would take in C or FORTRAN (0.1 sec on my SPARC). A further advantage
of this is that for simple operations (e.g. <CODE><STRONG>$x</STRONG> += 2</CODE>) one can manipulate
the whole array without caring about its dimensionality.
<p>I find when using perlDL it is most useful to think of standard perl
<CODE><STRONG>@x</STRONG></CODE> variables as ``lists'' of generic ``things'' and PDL variables like
<CODE><STRONG>$x</STRONG></CODE> as ``arrays'' which can be contained in lists or hashes. Quite
often in my perlDL scripts I have <CODE><STRONG>@x</STRONG></CODE> contain a list of spectra, or a
list of images (or even a mix!). Or perhaps one could have a hash
(e.g.  <CODE><STRONG>%x</STRONG></CODE>) of images... the only limit is memory!
<p>perlDL variables support a range of data types - arrays can be bytes,
short intgers (signed or unsigned), long integers, floats or
double precision floats.
<p>* It actually holds a reference (a smart ``pointer'') to this 
but that is not relevant for ordinary use of perlDL.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="PDL_usage_0">
Usage</A>
</H2>
perlDL is loaded into your perl script using these commands:
<p>
<XMP>
   use PDL;  # use the standard perlDL modules (Core Examples Io Graphics::PG)
   
   use PDL::Examples; # use only the Examples module (this will load 
                      # internally whatever other modules it needs).
   
   % perldl  # Invoke interactive shell from system command line.

</XMP>
<p>The default is to import all the function names from a module. If you
only want certain names imported just say:
<p>
<XMP>
   use PDL::Io qw(rfits rgrep) # Get only rfits() and rgrep from PDL::Io

</XMP>
<p>Also see below on ``Object-Orientation''.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="PDL_to_0">
To create a new PDL variable</A>
</H2>
Here are some ways of creating a PDL variable:
<p>
<XMP>
   $a = pdl [1..10];             # 1D array
   $a = pdl (1,2,3,4);           # Ditto
   $b = pdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];   # 2D 3x2 array
   $c = pdl $a;                  # Make a new copy
   
   $d = byte [1..10];            # See "Type conversion"
   $e = zeroes(3,2,4);           # 3x2x4 zero-filled array
   
   $c = rfits $file;             # Read FITS file 
   
   @x = ( pdl(42), zeroes(3,2,4), rfits($file) ); # Is a LIST of PDL variables!

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE><EM>pdl()</EM></CODE> function is used to initialise a PDL variable from a scalar,
list, list reference or another PDL variable.
<p>In addition all PDL functions automatically convert normal perl scalars
to PDL variables on-the-fly.
<p>(also see ``Type Conversion'' and ``Input/Output'' sections below)

<A NAME="PDL_arithmetic_0">

</H2>

<XMP>
 $a = $b + 2; $a++; $a = $b / $c; # Etc.
 
 $c=sqrt($a); $d = log10($b+100); # Etc
 
 $e = $a>42; # Vector condtional (like MATLAB) - 
             # note I think this is much nicer than IDLs WHERE(), e.g.:
 
 $e = 42*($a>42) + $a*($a<=42); # Cap top
 
 $a = $a / ( max($a) - min($a) );
 
 print $a; # $a in string context prints it in a N-dimensional format

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="PDL_matrix_0">
Matrix functions</A>
</H2>
<CODE>'x'</CODE> is hijacked as the matrix multiplication operator. e.g. 
<CODE><STRONG>$c</STRONG> = <STRONG>$a</STRONG> x <STRONG>$b</STRONG></CODE>;
<p>perlDL is row-major not column major so this is actually
<CODE>c(i,j) = sum_k a(k,j) b(i,k)</CODE> - but when matrices are printed the
results will look right. Just remember the indices are reversed.
e.g.:
<p>
<XMP>
      $a = [                   $b = [
            [ 1  2  3  0]            [1 1]
            [ 1 -1  2  7]            [0 2]
            [ 1  0  0  1]            [0 2]
           ]                         [1 1]
                                    ]
      gives $c = [
                  [ 1 11]
                  [ 8 10]

<p>Rules for automatic conversion during arithmetic:
<p>
<XMP>

  For VECTOR x SCALAR these rules avoid overpromotion of vector types:

  VECTOR INT   X SCALAR float/double   Return float
  VECTOR float X SCALAR float/double   Return float

<p>perlDL betrays its perl/C heritage in that arrays are zero-offset.
Thus a 100x100 image has indices <CODE>0..99,0..99</CODE>.
<p>Further I adopt the convention that the center of the pixel (0,0)
IS at coordinate (0.0,0.0). Thus the above image ranges from
<CODE>-0.5..99.5, -0.5..99.5</CODE> in real space. All perlDL graphics functions
conform to this defintion and hide away the unit-offsetness
of, for example, the PGPLOT FORTRAN library.
<p>Again following the usual convention coordinate (0,0) is displayed
at the bottom left when displaying an image. It appears at the
top right when using ``<CODE>print <STRONG>$a</STRONG></CODE>'' etc.
<p>
<XMP>
   $b  = sec($a,  $x1, $x2, $y1, $y2, $z1, $z2, ... ) # Take subsection
   $newimage = ins($bigimage,$smallimage,$x,$y,$z...) # Insert at x,y,z
   
   $c  = nelem ($a); # Number of pixels
   
   $val = at($object, $x,$y,$z...)    # Pixel value at position
   set($myimage, $x, $y, ... $value)  # Set value in image

                   # axisvals($x,$axis) and rvals() for radial distance 
                   # from centre).

The philosophy behind perlDL is to make it work with a variety of
existing graphics libraries since no single package will satisfy all
needs and all people and this allows one to work with packages one
already knows and likes.  Obviously there will be some overlaps in
functionality and some lack of consistency and uniformity. This also
saves the author from too much work in time he doesn't have!

<OL>
<LI>PGPLOT
<p>PGPLOT provdes a simple library for line graphics and image display.
<p>There is an easy interface to this in the interna;l module
PDL::Graphics::PG. (This calls routines in the separately available
PGPLOT top-level module.)
<p>Current display commands:
<p>
<XMP>
   imag         -  Display an image (uses pgimag()/pggray() as appropriate)
   ctab         -  Load an image colour table
   line         -  Plot vector as connected points
   points       -  Plot vector as points
   errb         -  Plot error bars
   cont         -  Display image as contour map
   bin          -  Plot vector as histogram ( e.g. bin(hist($data)) )
   hi2d         -  Plot image as 2d histogram (not very good IMHO...)
   poly         -  Draw a polygon
   vect         -  Display 2 images as a vector field

</XMP>
<p>Device manipulation commands:
<p>
<XMP>
   hold         -  Hold current plot window range - allows overlays etc.
   release      -  Release back to autoscaling of new plot window for each command
   rel          -  short alias for 'release'
   env          -  Define a plot window, put on 'hold'
   dev          -  Explicitly set a new PGPLOT graphics device
   
e.g:
   perldl> $a = pdl [1..100]
   perldl> $b = sqrt($a)
   perldl> line $b      
   perldl> hold
   Graphics on HOLD
   perldl> $c = sin($a/10)*2 + 4
   perldl> line $c     

</XMP>
<p>Notes: <STRONG>$transform</STRONG> for image/cont etc. is used in the same way as the
<EM>TR()</EM> array in the underlying PGPLOT FORTRAN routine but is, fortunately,
zero-offset.
<p>It is also hoped to use other graphic libraries to enable more sophisticated
plots then is possible with PGPLOT. Some ideas:

<LI>IIS
<p>Many astronomers like to use SAOimage and Ximtool (or there
derivations/clones). These are useful free widgets for inspection and
visualisation of images. (They are not provided with perlDL but can
easily be obtained from their official sites off the Net.)
<p>The PDL::Graphics::IIS package provides allows one to display images
in these (``IIS'' is the name of an ancient item of image display
hardware whose protocols these tools conform to.)
<p>Commands are:
<p>
<XMP>
   iis         - display image
   iiscur      - return a cursor position
   iiscirc     - draw circles on image display
   saoimage    - start SAOimage 
   ximtool     - start Ximtool

</XMP>
<p>Variables are:
<p>
<XMP>
   $stdimage  - frame buffer configuration
   $iisframe  - frame buffer number to display in

</XMP>
<p>The frame buffer configuration is set by the variable <STRONG>$stdimage</STRONG>
(analagous to iraf) whose default is ``imt1024''. System and user
imtoolrc files are parsed so if you know about these you can do
the same tricks as you can in with IRAF.

This provides a simple way to pass the data arrays from pdl

<p>The syntax is:
<p>
<XMP>
   callext($file,$symbol, @pdl_list) 

</XMP>
<p><STRONG>@pdl_list</STRONG> is a list of pdl variables. Numbers get converted
automatically. The file must be dynamically loadable object code - how
the C compiler generates this will be different from system to system
so see your man pages.
<p>The C routine takes args <CODE>(int nargs, pdl *args)</CODE>. The C type <CODE>``pdl''</CODE> is a
simple data structure representing the perl pdl variable. It is defined
in file ``pdl.h'' which is included in the perlDL distribution and has no
perl dependencies.  It is trivial to cast the data array (pdl.data) to
(float), (double) etc. and pass to any other C routine.
<p>This is all demonstrated in the files ``testcallext.*'' in the perlDL
distribution.

for the scientist/hacker. perlDL developers should write a module
along the lines of the example PDL::Examples.

Object-Orientation and perlDL</A>
</H2>
[Astronomers can ignore this bit! :-)]
<p>pdl variables such as <STRONG>$x</STRONG> are implemented via Perl objects. However
I have chosen to use an all-functional approach to perlDL syntax yo
be  more astronomer friendly.
<p>However you can use perlDL in an OO fashion. In fact if you say:
<p>
<XMP>
   use PDL::OO;

</XMP>
<p>It will load PDL functions as OO methods in the PDL class. This
means you can say things like:
<p>
<XMP>
   $a = PDL->rfits('m51.fits');
   $b = PDL->new([1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1]);
   $smooth = $a->convolve($b);
   $smooth->iis;

</XMP>
<p>You can start the perldl shell in this mode with ``perldl -oo''.
<p>Note: as you can see from the above all functions which create pdl
variables are used with construct syntax in the OO mode. Finally you
can even use both forms by simply saying ``use PDL; use PDL::OO''.
<p>You can inherit from PDL methods (e.g. to a class Foo)
by simply saying:
<p>
<XMP>
   @Foo::ISA = ('PDL');               # Method path
   %Foo::OVERLOAD = %PDL::OVERLOAD;   # Copy overload

</XMP>
<p>Then PDL methods will work on Foo objects as long as you simply build
on the existing PDL data structure (see below) components.
<p>So it would be possible to provide USER written modules to do really
cool stuff for specific application areas, e.g. PDL::Spectrum might
provide a <STRONG>$a</STRONG> which understands X-axes and error bars and +-/+ etc.
might be overriden to do the Right Thing (tm). And writing the module
would not be rocket science - just some cool perl hacking.
<p>And you would not have to even use method syntax - if <STRONG>$a</STRONG> came out of my
hypothetical PDL::Spectrum all the standard pdl functions (like <EM>hist()</EM>
to give a concreate example) would work on it in the standard way
provided they simply built on the existing PDL data structure (which
means simply containing a <STRONG>$$</STRONG>a{Data} etc. PDL::Spectrum could even
export it's own <EM>hist()</EM> function to override the built-in which might do
something more sophisticated using the X-axis for example.
<p>If you were feeling really ambitious you might do PDL::Ir::Spectrum
which understood about the gaps between the J H and K bands!

<A NAME="PDL_memory_0">
Memory usage and references</A>
</H2>
Messing around with really huge data arrays may require some care.
perlDL provides some facilities to let you perform operations on big
arrays without generating extra copies though this does require a bit
more thought are care from the programmer.
<p>NOTE: On some most systems it is better to configure perl (during the
build options) to use the system <EM>malloc()</EM> function rather than perl's
built-in one. This is because perl's one is optimised for speed rather
than consumption of virtual memory - this can result in a factor of
two improvement in the amount of memory storage you can use.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Simple arithmetic
<p>If <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is a big image (e.g. occupying 10MB) and I say:
<p>
<XMP>
   $a = $a + 1;

</XMP>
<p>then the total <EM>malloc()</EM>'d memory usage grows to 20MB. This is because
the expression ``<STRONG>$a</STRONG>+1'' creates a temporary copy of <STRONG>$a</STRONG> to hold the
result, then <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is assigned a reference to that. It is obviously done
this way so ``<STRONG>$c</STRONG>=<STRONG>$a</STRONG>+1'' works as expected.
<p>Also if one says:
<p>
<XMP>
   $b = $a;     # $b and $a now point to same data
   $a = $a + 1;

<p>Then <STRONG>$b</STRONG> and <STRONG>$a</STRONG> end up being different, as one naively expects,
because a new reference is created and <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is assigned to it.
<p>However if <STRONG>$a</STRONG> was a huge memory hog (e.g. a 3D volume) creating a copy
of it may not be a good thing. One can avoid this memory overhead in
the above example by saying:
<p>
<XMP>
   $a++;

</XMP>
<p>The operations <CODE>++,+=,--,-=</CODE>, etc. all call a special ``in-place''
version of the arithmetic subroutine. This means no more memory is
needed - the downside of this is that if <STRONG>$b</STRONG>=<STRONG>$a</STRONG> then <STRONG>$b</STRONG> is also
incremented. To force a copy explicitly:
<p>
<XMP>
   $b = pdl $a; # Real copy

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Functions
<p>Most functions, e.g. <EM>log()</EM>, return a result which is a transformation
of their argument. This makes for good programming practice. However many 
operations can be done ``in-place'' and this may be required when large
arrays are in use and memory is at a premium. For these circumstances
the operator <EM>inplace()</EM> is provided which prevents the extra copy and
allows the argument to be modified. e.g.:
<p>
<XMP>
   $x = log($array);          # $array unaffected
   log( inplace($bigarray) ); # $bigarray changed in situ

</XMP>

<A NAME="PDL_data_0">
Data Structure Guts</A>
</H2>
(For born fiddlers only.)
<p>The data structure for <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is implemented by a hash (associative array)
which <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is a (blessed) reference too.
<p>PDL reserves for it's own use:
<p>
<XMP>
   $$a{Data} ; # The DATA (byte list) - can be passed directly to F77/C
               # subroutine as long as type matches. e.g. line() does a
               # float() and then calls PGPLOT::pgline_r (bypassing packing)
   
   $$a{Datatype}; # Holds numeric data type, $PDL_F, $PDL_D, etc...
   
   $$a{Dims} ; # List reference holding dimensions. 
               # E.g. @mydims = @{ $$a{Dims} };
   
   $$a{Hdr}  ; # Optional extra hash reference holding header, e.g.
               # $airmass = $$a{Hdr}{'AIRMASS'}; %myhdr = %{ $$a{Hdr} };
               # rfits() populates this from the FITS header.
   
   $$a{Inplace}; # Flag - inplace() sets this. Next time a copy is attempted
                 # it does not occur and the flag is unset.

</XMP>
<p>Anything else stored in the structure will be copied to new objects
(e.g. by <STRONG>$b</STRONG> = <STRONG>$a</STRONG> + 1) automatically as long as PDL knows how to copy it.
[If it is a reference to another object PDL tries the -&gt;copy method.]
<p>If your perl routine manipulates the data structure guts directly, 
you don't want it to blow up in your face if you pass it a simple
number rather than a PDL variable. Simply call the function 
<EM>topdl()</EM> first to make it safe. e.g.:
<p>
<XMP>
   sub myfiddle { my $pdl = topdl(shift); $$pdl{Data} = ... }

</XMP>
<p><EM>topdl()</EM> does NOT perform a copy if a pdl variable is passed - it
just falls through - which is obviosuly the desired behaviour. The
routine is not of course necessary in normal user defined functions
which do not care about internals.
<p>Finally there is no reason why the data structure should not
contain another PDL variable!
