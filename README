This is version 1.11 of PDL
---------------------------

It demonsrates basic data processing functionality but has no where
near the features I would like to eventually put in it. The current
docs are in file PDL.pod.

Comments are welcome - so are volunteers to write code! Please contact
me (kgb@aaoepp.aao.gov.au) or mailing list perldl@jach.hawaii.edu
(subscription address:  perldl-request@jach.hawaii.edu) with ideas and
suggestions.

Requirements.
-------------

perl5.003 or later. (Probably OK with 5.002 but I can not test.)

PGPLOT v2.0 (or higher) module must be installed and working to 
access PGPLOT graphics.

saoimage or ximtool must be installed to display images with
these programs.

ReadLines/ReadKey modules must be installed for command line
editing and recall in 'perldl' shell.

Building and Installation
--------------------------

Should be simply a matter of:

; perl Makefile.PL
; make
; make test
; make install
