PDL -- the package
------------------

The perlDL project aims to turn perl into an efficient numerical language for
scientific computing. The PDL module gives standard perl the ability to
COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data sets which
are the bread and butter of scientific computing. e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two
2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.

The aim is to provide tons of useful functionality for
scientific and numeric analysis.

Check the pdl web site at http://pdl.perl.org for more information.


Installation
------------

Please read the file INSTALL for detailed information on how
to configure and install PDL.

Once you have built PDL and either installed it or done
'make doctest', try either

	perl -Mblib perldl

from within the root of the PDL tree or just

	perldl
	
if you have installed PDL already ('make install') to get the
interactive pdl shell. In this shell, 'help' gives you
access to PDL documentation for each function separately ('help
help' for more about this) and 'demo' gives you some basic
examples of what you can do.


Notes
-----

Directory structure:

Basic/	   - The stuff that PDL would be no use without
Lib/	   - The stuff that PDL would still be useful without but
	     which makes PDL even more useful
Graphics/  - The stuff that PDL needs to make pictures
IO/	   - The stuff that PDL needs to write and read strange files

The new organization makes it possible in the future to make "PDL-Lite"
(just the Basic/ directory) if that seems necessary.

This distribution has parts at different levels of
completion - usually they are marked in the docs but here is
a brief rundown of what is good and what is something you need
to know what you're doing to use:

Basic/  	stable
Graphics/PGPLOT stable (an updated version, with an OO interface, is 
		in the works)
Graphics/TriD	recently undergone a major update.
Lib/Opt/Simplex	works
Lib/Slatec
		Should in principle work but porting is difficult.
		If you can't compile it, remove it from Lib/Makefile.PL
Lib/GSL
		Interface to the Random distributions of the GNU
		Scientific Library. You might have to modify the
		perldl.conf file so PDL knows were to find the lib
		and include directories when building PDL.
		See DEPENDENCIES file for more info. 
IO/Misc		stable
IO/FastRaw	stable.

Comments are welcome - so are volunteers to write code! Please contact the
developers mailing list pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu (subscription address: 
pdl-porters-request@jach.hawaii.edu) with ideas and suggestions.

Compilation Reports:
--------------------

The CPAN Testers' result page provides a database showing the results
of compiling PDL and many other CPAN packages on multiple platforms.
