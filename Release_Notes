Release notes for PDL 2.4.4_03 ---------------------------

General Notes:

     *************************************
     *                                   *
     *   This is a development release   *
     *                                   *
     *************************************

     t/proj_transform fails due to problem
     loading the input data via the
     earth_image() routine. Debugging has
     been added.

     t/pic_16bit fails because of an old
     netpbm version. Clean up by adding
     a config variable whether 16bit raw
     PNM are allowed and honor that in
     the rpic/wpic code. Skip tests if
     appropriate.  TODO

     t/storable.t failure to load compiled
     module waiting on detailed test run from
     reporter.  TODO

     CPAN sets PERL5OPT=-MDevel::Autoflush
     but this is problematic with perl
     scripts run under controlled
     environments. Need to figure out a way
     around this.  TODO

     "No rule to make target pptemplate
     needed by pptemplate.pod" which may be
     a make specific problem, related to the
     version of EU::MM or something else...
     Need to request Basic/Gen Makefile
     output and make program and EU::MM info
     from reporter.  TODO


Summary of Changes:

     TBD

General Notes:

     *************************************
     *                                   *
     *   This is a development release   *
     *                                   *
     *************************************

Summary of Changes:

     - Several SF.net bugs have been fixed

     - pctover() and oddpctover() should generate more accurate
       results with greater consistency to MS Excel calculations

     - PDL should pass automated build tests on more platforms


Release notes for PDL 2.4.4 ------------------------------

General Notes:

     - Bad value support is now enabled by default for
       PDL builds.  This feature allows simpler handling
       of missing or invalid data during processing.

       For example, missing pixels could be interpolated
       across.  Calculations could be skipped for
       missing data points...
       
       Edit the perldl.conf file to turn off bad value
       support before compiling if needed.

     - This release includes significant improvments
       in portability, enhancements in functionality,
       and *many* bugs fixed.

     - PDL::Graphics::TriD modules for 3-D and image
       visualization are being refactored for improved
       portability and performance.  Preliminary hooks
       are in PDL-2.4.4 to support the new functionality.
       
       Announcements to the perldl mailing list will be
       made when the PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl and
       Term::ReadLine::FreeGLUT suport is on CPAN.

     - Builds out-of-the-box on cygwin and win32
     
     - perl 5.6.x is explicitly required to configure and
       will go away in future versions.  5.8.x and above
       are the recommended versions

Summary of Changes:

     - Improve uuencode support in Dumper for additional OSes
       such as *BSD varieties that may need additional options
       to prevent stripping of the leading slash in pathnames
       including: darwin, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, and dragonfly.
      
     - Updated more PDL tests to use the recommended Test::More
      
     - Updated PDL::Graphics::PLplot build support for more 5.9.0
       specific features
      
     - AutoLoader ~ expansion has been updated to conform more
       closely to the ~ expansion in the bash shell
      
     - Better checks for a valid PROJ4 build environment are now
       performed before attempting to compile PDL modules using it
      
     - PDL now builds and runs on perl-5.10.x
      
     - The perldl shell has added support for using FreeGLUT for
       display in analogy with the existing Tk event loop support.
       This enables refactoring of the TriD modules to use the
       Perl OpenGL module (a.k.a. POGL) instead of the internal,
       and deprecated, PDL::Graphics::OpenGL et. al.
      
     - The perldl acquire/filter/execute loop is now $_-safe by
       using $lines instead of $_ for all the central modifications.
       Avoids problems with some AUTOLOAD functions that leaked $_.
      
     - Removed ExtUtils::F77 from the required prerequisites for
       PDL to improve the buildability on platforms without an
       available fortran compiler.  If you have a fortran compiler
       and EU::F77 installed, PDL::Slatec will be built.
      
     - zeros function added as an alias for the zeroes function
         
     - Many warning messages that were not actually problems have
       been quieted, especially many pointer to int conversion messages
      
     - Added $PERLDL::HISTFILESIZE to allow configuration of the number
       of lines of history to be saved by the interactive PDL shell.
      
     - Fixed implementation of the pctover() function to address bug
       #2019651 on sf.net.  Added explicit documentation in the code
       on the algorithm being used.
      
     - Various updates to the PDL FAQ
      
     - Implemented a PDL interface to the Minuit minimization library
       from CERN
      
     - Removed circular dependency in PDL Makefile.PL Makefile generation
       process which caused builds with some versions of make to fail
      
     - Multiple fixes to enhance configuration and build for win32
     
     - Added basic table-inversion to t_lookup for PDL::Transform
      
     - Fixed problem in uniqvec() where it failed to generate a correct
       result if all the input vectors were the same, fixed bug #1869760
      
     - Add improved 16-bit image support for IO with rpic() and wpic()
       provided you have a recent version of the NetPBM library that
       supports 16-bit images
      
     - Enabled building of GSL on Win32.
    

Release notes for PDL 2.4.3 ------------------------------

General Notes:

     - again, mainly a bugfix and polishing release.

     - builds out-of-the-box on cygwin and win32 build environment
       has been significantly improved
     
     - perl 5.6.x is now deprecated; 5.8.x is recommended.  Support
       for 5.6.x may go away in future versions.  


Summary of Changes:

     - PDL now builds under cygwin on windows PC including
       TriD(OpenGL) 3D graphics and PGPLOT and PLplot 2D graphics
       support. See PDL/cygwin/ and files README and INSTALL for
       details and how to build/install external dependencies.
     
     - The win32 build has been improved.  See PDL/win32/INSTALL
       for details.
     
     - Many fixes from the Debian build patches have been
       incorporated.  See PDL/debian for specifics.
     
     - 64bit platform build has been improved.
     
     - New functionality, functions and modules:
         
         * Bad value support has been extended to per-PDL bad
           values as an experimental feature. To use, configure
           WITH_BADVAL => 1 and BADVAL_PER_PDL => 1 in perldl.conf
           before building.

         * PDL::GSL::INTEG now supports the calculation of
           nested integrals

         * New function tcircle (threaded circle) added to 
           PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT This draws multiple circles in
           one go (see also tpoints and tline)

         * Added set operation routines for pdls treated as sets
           (help setops).

         * PDL::IO::GD module interface to the GD runtime image
           libaray (http://www.boutell.com/gd/) has been integrated.

         * The PDL::GIS::Proj and PDL::Transform::Proj4 modules
           to interface to the PROJ4 Cartographic Projections
           Library (http://proj.maptools.org/) have been added.

         * PDL::IO::HDF provides an interface to the HDF4
           library (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/).
     
     
     - The PDL test suite (i.e. tests in in PDL/t) has been
       enhanced. Coverage has improved and output diagnostic
       messages are more useful. Test::More is becoming the
       preferred test module. The vanilla Test and Test::Simple
       may be deprecated in the future.

     - PDL core code has been fixed to address valgrind-detected
       errors and to enable better bad value support including the
       new experimental per-PDL bad values. These changes will
       require a re-build/install of any external modules using
       the C interface of PDL. See perldl.conf to configure the
       new bad value support.

     - Several TriD graphics build problems have been resolved.
       The TriD rotation bug has been fixed.

     - Many other bug fixes too numerous to mention. See the
       PDL/Changes file for details.

     - Multiple fixes and additions to PDL documentation as well
       as the PDL::FAQ.

 - New 'pdl' command-line entry to perldl shell allows #!-style
   scripting (so you can re-use your journal files verbatim)

 - Several fixes for Microsoft Windows operation

 - PDL::undefval works properly, also has warning tripwires

 - statsover finally seems to produce meaningful, consistent RMS values

 - Several 64-bit compatibility issues (this work is probably not yet

Release notes for PDL 2.4.0 -------------------------------

General Notes:

     - Perl 5.6.0 or later is now required, along with the modules
       Filter and Text::Balanced.

     - After installing PDL 2.4.0 external PDL modules will need to re-built.
       (any such modules will refuse to load until they have been re-built)
       
     - New demos of the PDL::Transform and PDL::Transform::Cartography
        modules have been added to perldl.
       Type 'demo transform' or 'demo cartography' in the perldl shell. 
        ( Note that PGPLOT is required to run )

Summary of Changes:

     - The NiceSlice syntax comes of age
       (Nice slicing has been around a while, but really needs to be 
        acknowledged as the main way of slicing PDLs...)

     - New GSL functionality: greatly improved access to the Gnu Scientific
       Library, including interpolation, finite-difference, random
       variable, and other routines.

     - New, very powerful indexing and slicing operators allow boundary 
          conditions   (range, indexND)

     - N-dimensional indexing (indexND) and selection (whichND) methods

     - Powerful syntax for coordinate transformation and arbitrary image
       resampling and coordinate transformations -- including high powered
       spatially-variable filtering (PDL::Transform module)

     - Support for major cartographic transformations
       (PDL::Transform::Cartography module)

     - New PLPlot graphics interface ( cleaner and faster than PGPLOT )

     - Many improvements to the PGPlot interface:
       * Strong FITS support (easy display of images, vectors, & contours in
            science coordinates)
       * Better vector graphic support [including improvements to line() and
         a new routine, lines()]
       * Much cleanup of errors and bugs
       * Spinlocks prevent interrupt-related PGPLOT crashes (requires Perl 5.8)
       * RGB output to truecolor devices (requires PGPLOT-5.3devel)

     - Improvements to the perldl shell:
       * Many bug fixes
       * Multi-line inputs to the perldl shell for easier cut-n-paste
       * ^D blocking on demand (controlled by perl variable or command-line 
          switch)
       * Autoloading detects error conditions on compile
       * New demos

    - Header copying is now explicit rather than by reference -- so that,
      e.g., FITS file manipulation is more intuitive and natural.

    - Improved support for Astro::FITS::Header

    - Bad value support is improved

    - Several new utility routines, including glue(), zcheck(), and ndcoords().

    - Better matrix operation support: matrix operations are now in 
        PDL::MatrixOps, and are all threadable.  Singular value decomposition,
        determinant, linear equation solving, matrix inversion, 
        eigenvalue decomposition, and LU-decomposition.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.4 -------------------------------

     - Now should compile using perl 5.8.0
     - Improved speed for generating PDL's from a perl array ref
     - Added PDL::IO::Storable, which enables PDL storage/retrieval
       using the Storable package.
     - Added  PDL::GSL::SF (Gnu Scientific Library, Special Functions) hierarchy
     - New % operator follows (mathematically correct) perl % operator behavior
     - Numerous Bug Fixes
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.3 -------------------------------
  
  Mainly a bugfix release with some nice little additions:
     - PDL::IO::Dumper: Cleanly save and restore complex
        data structures including PDLs.  
     - Support for the new Astro::FITS::Header module
       (availiable on CPAN).
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.2 ------------------------------

A pure bugfix release to fix compilation problems with gimp-perl
(part of the gimp distribution). The following notes from
2.3 and 2.3.1 still apply:

Release notes for PDL 2.3.1 ------------------------------

A bugfix release to fix some compilation problems seen with
2.3. The following notes from 2.3 still apply:

Release notes for PDL 2.3 -------------------------------
 
 Summary of Changes
   - A nicer slicing syntax for PDL added via the new 
     PDL::NiceSlice module.
   - Inline::Pdlpp module added, which enables in-line
     PDL::PP definitions. (i.e. no Makefiles, building
      hassles for creating PP code)
   - A Multitude of bug fixes, doc updates, and other
     changes.
     
  Note:Support for perl version 5.005 and previous is 
  limited in this release. Perl 5.6.0 or greater is
  recommended for full PDL functionality.
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.
  
Release notes for PDL 2.2.1 -------------------------------
 
 Summary of Changes
    Bugs Fixed:
          - 'pow' function fixed in math.pd
          - Misc memory leaks fixed.
          - PGPLOT 'undefined window size' 
             bug fixed.
          - Test failures with opengl.t fixed.
          - Error in output of 'minimum_n_ind' function
            fixed.
            
    Misc Changes:
        - Documentation updates.
        - Updates to work with perl5.6.1
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.
  
Release notes for PDL 2.2 -------------------------------

Major Changes:

  - 'Bad' Value Support added. With this option compiled-in, certain
     values in a PDL can be designated as 'Bad' (i.e. missing, empty, 
     etc). With this designation, most PDL functions will properly 
     ignore the 'Bad' values. See PDL::BadValues for details.
     
  - PGPLOT interface rewritten. New Features:
      - Interactive cursors (cursor)
      - Text on plots       (text)
      - Legends             (legend)
      - Circles, Rectangles, Ellipses
      - Multiple plot windows, one can jump from panel to panel when
        the window is divided in several.
      - More control over options - see PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions for
        details.
      - New Examples in Example/PGPLOT.

   - Major updates to the Tri-D Code. Now requires perl 5.6 for TriD.
    
   - 'Reduce' function added. This provides a consistent interface to the
     projection routines (sumover, average, etc). See PDL::Reduce.
     
   - Improved OpenGL detection during 'perl Makefile.PL

   - pdldoc command added. This allows you to look up PDL 
     documentation similar to the perldoc command. 
     
   - Perl 5.6 is now recommended for PDL 2.2. It will still work 
     with perl 5.005, but some of the extra libs won't be compiled
     ( like Graphics/TriD).
  
Many other changes. See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.1 -------------------------------

Major Changes:
  - Speed Increase. Most PDL functions are now done totally
    in C-code, without any perl wrapper functions as was done
    with previous versions. The speedup will be most noticeable
    for operations on many small PDL arrays.
  - Mem Leaks Fixed.
  - Added a consistent, Object-Oriented interface to the 
    various interpolate functions in PDL. (PDL::Func, 
    See Lib/Func.pm).
    
See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.



Release notes for PDL 2.005 -----------------------------

A bugfix release to fix 2.004 problems with PGPLOT changes
and perl 5.6.0.

The following notes from 2.004 still apply:
                                             
*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Due to changes to the PGPLOT module, 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT' has been removed from PDL.pm (i.e. in scripts
and within perldl you now need to explicitly say 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT'). Additionally, it needs Karl's new 2.16
release of the PGPLOT module (available from CPAN).

Notable additions are a module for operations on complex piddles
(PDL::Complex), a subtype of PDL which allows manipulation of byte
type PDLs as N dimensional arrays of fixed length strings (PDL::Char)
and a Levenberg-Marquardt fitting module (PDL::Fit::LM).

Bug reports and patches to the relevant places on sourceforge, please.
