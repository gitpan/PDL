Release notes for PDL 2.1.1 -------------------------------

A quick bugfix release to ensure PDL works with
perl 'usethreads=y'.

Still valid are the release notes for PDL 2.1 -------------

Major Changes:
  - Speed Increase. Most PDL functions are now done totally
    in C-code, without any perl wrapper functions as was done
    with previous versions. The speedup will be most noticeable
    for operations on many small PDL arrays.
  - Mem Leaks Fixed.
  - Added a consistent, Object-Oriented interface to the 
    various interpolate functions in PDL. (PDL::Func, 
    See Lib/Func.pm).
    
See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.



Release notes for PDL 2.005 -----------------------------

A bugfix release to fix 2.004 problems with PGPLOT changes
and perl 5.6.0.

The following notes from 2.004 still apply:
                                             
*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Due to changes to the PGPLOT module, 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT' has been removed from PDL.pm (i.e. in scripts
and within perldl you now need to explicitly say 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT'). Additionally, it needs Karl's new 2.16
release of the PGPLOT module (available from CPAN).

Notable additions are a module for operations on complex piddles
(PDL::Complex), a subtype of PDL which allows manipulation of byte
type PDLs as N dimensional arrays of fixed length strings (PDL::Char)
and a Levenberg-Marquardt fitting module (PDL::Fit::LM).

Bug reports and patches to the relevant places on sourceforge, please.
