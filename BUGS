REPORTING BUGS
--------------

Please submit bug reports via the sourceforge bug
tracker interface at

   http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=612

You may submit bugs anonymously but if possible
please provide a way for the developers to contact
you about the problem.

Try to include any information you think might
help the developer isolate, reproduce and fix
your problem.  Things that are often helpful:

    * Details about your operating environment
      that might be related to the problem

    * Exact cut and pasted error or warning messages

    * The shortest, clearest code you can manage
      to write which reproduces the bug described.

    * A patch against the latest released version
      of this distribution which fixes this bug.

At a minimum, include the following information:

    * PDL version number (e.g. PDL-2.4.4)

    * Perl version information
      (output from "perl -v" or "perl -V", even better!)

    * Operating System
      (run the "uname -a" command on many unix systems)

If you are reporting a bug with an installed PDL,
please include the full output of

  perldl -V

If the PDL has compiled and built but not installed,
you may be able to run

  perl -Mblib perldl -V

from the top level of the PDL build directory.

Submit your bug report to the bug database 

Alternatively, send an e-mail report with the above
information (including the output of 'perldl -V')
to pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu . See

   http://pdl.perl.org/maillists

for info on how to subscribe to this list
if necessary.



BEFORE YOU SEND A REPORT
------------------------

BEFORE you report a bug make sure you got the latest
release version of PDL (always available from CPAN,
check http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=PDL). Also
check the FAQ (http://pdl/sourceforge.net/FAQ) and
the mailing list archives for hints. You can find
links to the searchable archives at

   http://pdl.perl.org/maillists



PATCHES
-------

Patches can be sent to the pdl-porters mailing list
(see above) or can be directly submitted to the
patch manager

   http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=612

Patches should be made against the latest released
PDL or, ideally, against the current CVS sources
which you can browse and check out at

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=612


Thanks,
The pdl-porters team.
