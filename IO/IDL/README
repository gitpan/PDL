Some time ago, I wrote a PDL::IO::IDL module and uplinked it to CVS.
Due to administrative hassles with my company, I was forced to not
release a final version of the code. At their request, I have removed
IDL.pm from this directory.  The in-progress code is still present in
the CVS attic at Sourceforge.net, together with the reverse-engineered
specification published by Craig Markwardt.  If you have not signed
the IDL license agreement, please feel free to examine the file
specification and the prototype code in the attic, fix them up, and
add them back in.
