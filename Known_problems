The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.1.3 is the current release version of the library but
  is not supported by PDL::FFTW.  You can install version 2.1.5
  of FFTW, fall back on the built-in fft routines, or (best of
  all) submit a patch. 

- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  configure, built, test process.  This can be confusing for first
  time users.

- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.

- PDL::Graphics::TriD is in the process of being refactored.
  Only minor fixes have occurred since PDL-2.4.3.  Please check
  for releases of PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl for the new implementation.

- make problems with build:
  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.
  - Make fails with message like
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
      If you have this error, please contact the PDL developers via the perldl
      mailing list and help us track this one down.  Thanks!

- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear to result
  from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode or uudecode.  Work
  is underway to diagnose this further but if you install Convert::UU that
  should resolve the problem.  Patches welcome.

- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp files
  are not creatable.  This appears to be a result of platform misconfiguration
  but we need data points to understand the issue.

- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to an
  older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit formats.

- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the 2.4.4
  point release:

  2780046    make does not make docs 
  2630369    PDL::FFT::fftconvolve - bad scaling?
