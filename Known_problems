The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.1.3 is now out but is not supported by PDL::FFTW (yet).
  You can use version 2.1.5 of FFTW, fall back on the built-in
  fft routines, or (best of all) submit a patch. 

- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  configure, built, test process.  This can be confusing for first
  time users.

- Because of build dependency resolution, the make process will
  repeat compiles multiple times for the various steps.  This
  will produce a correct build in the end but you'll just have
  to wait.  Sorry.

- PDL::Graphics::TriD is in the process of being refactored.
  Only minor fixes have occurred since PDL-2.4.3.  Please check
  for releases of PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl for the new implementation.

- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the 2.4.4
  point release:
