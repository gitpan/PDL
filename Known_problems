The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:

- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.12 has a new
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to make an
  explicit temp as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;

  becomes

    my $tmp; # work around perl -d "feature"
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;

  The problem is understood and it is hoped that an official
  fix will become available soon.  NOTE: the work around is
  100% effective---but ugly.


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- The default TriD controls are based on having 2+ button mouse.

  For Macs with one button, you can use Ctrl+Click to generate
  the needed Right-click.  It is also possible to configure the
  Macbook tracpad to generate a secondary click via the control panel.


- PDL::FFTW is based on version 2 of the FFTW API.  The current
  release of the FFTW library is version 3.2.2.  To use PDL::FFTW
  you will need to install FFTW version 2.1.5, use the built-in 
  PDL::FFT routines instead, or (better yet) submit a patch to
  update PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- If you have a pre-existing PDL install in your perl @INC path,
  mysterious failures have been observed in some tests due to
  unintentionally pulling in the wrong version of PDL.  The
  'perl Makefile.PL' stage now checks for this and prompts to
  continue so you'll know the potential problem exists.


- Various make command issues during build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail; so don't use -j # options.
  - make fails with message like.
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
    The cause is unknown.  If you have this problem, *please* let the developers
    know via the perldl mailing list.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- PDL on Cygwin has a 300MB process memory limit which can
  cause out of memory crashes with large data sets.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.6_017 release:

  3031068    PDL::IO::FlexRaw memory mapping fails
  3018731    NiceSlice affects code where it should not
