The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL. 

- Some bus errors have been reported with PDL and perl 5.005
  built with the threading option.

- SGI format failure on some machines in t/picnorgb.t and t/picrgb.t
(Jarle Brinchmann reported this on 11/3/98).

- The html docs for the modules in IO/Misc aren't being built during 'make
  install'. 

- Some problems have been reported with PDL and perl5.005 on R5000 Indy
  machine running Irix 6.2. This was corrected by re-compiling perl without
  the perl-provided malloc.
