The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:

- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.12 has a new
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to make an
  explicit temp as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;

  becomes

    my $tmp; # work around perl -d "feature"
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;

  The problem is understood and it is hoped that an official
  fix will become available soon.  NOTE: the work around is
  100% effective---but ugly.


- PDL::IO::Dumper sdump() fails for some system configurations.
  Problems have been reported for various BSD platforms.  Please
  use PDL::IO::Storable if you have this problem *and* let the
  PDL developer know (Bonus points if you can work with us to
  debug this problem---which has only languished because we don't
  have the ability to create the bug to fix it...).  Thanks.


- On Strawberry Perl and ActiveState Perl the pdl2 fallback to
  perldl when Devel::REPL and Term::ReadLine::Perl are not
  installed is broken due to win32 issues.
  
  If you get stuck in the pdl2 shell, just type
  quit<Enter>quit<Enter> which issues the quit command to both
  the pdl2-now-perldl shell and the CMD shell.  You'll need to
  call perldl explicitly for now (or install Devel::REPL
  and Term::ReadLine::Perl to use the new pdl2 goodness...).


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- PDL::FFTW is based on version 2 of the FFTW API.  The current
  release of the FFTW library is version 3.2.2.  To use PDL::FFTW
  you will need to install FFTW version 2.1.5, use the built-in 
  PDL::FFT routines instead, or (better yet) submit a patch to
  update PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- If you have a pre-existing PDL install in your perl @INC path,
  mysterious failures have been observed in some tests due to
  unintentionally pulling in a previous version of PDL.  The
  'perl Makefile.PL' stage now checks for this and asks if you
  wish to continue.
  
  Usually, continuing with another PDL in the path will work
  BUT if you get mysterious test failures, try removing the
  previous PDL install files and build again.


- Various make command issues during build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail; so don't use -j # options.

  - make fails with message like.
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
    The cause is unknown.  If you have this problem, *please* let the developers
    know via the perldl mailing list.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- Directory completion in the interactive PDL shells (perldl and pdl2)
  using Term::ReadLine::Perl adds a space after each directory expansion.
  To continue to complete, one must delete the space before typing <TAB>
  again.  The problem has been reported to the Term::ReadLine::Perl
  bug tracker.

- PDL on Cygwin has a 300MB process memory limit which can cause out
  of memory crashes with large data sets.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.7_002 release:

  3079844    t/flexraw_fortran.t fails with long temp directory name
  3059083    Problems with FITS header handling
  3057542    wmpeg doesn't error on missing ffmpeg
  3056142    pdl2 fallback to perldl broken on win32
  3042201    t/dumper.t fails mysteriously
  3031068    PDL::IO::FlexRaw mapflex memory mapping fails
  3018731    NiceSlice affects code where it should not
  3011879    pdl() constructor crashes for mixed array ref/piddle args

               NOTE: A partial fix is in PDL-2.4.7_001.
	       The constructor no longer crashes perl
	       however 3 constructor tests fail.  Work
	       is underway to resolve these.
