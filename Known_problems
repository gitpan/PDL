The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.0.1 is now out but is not supported (yet). You can use 2.x versions
  of FFTW, fall back on the built-in fft routines, or (best of all) submit a 
  patch. 

- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from configure,
  built, test process.  This can be confusing for first time users.

- Compiler warnings from external code interfaces for several modules
  including for the following files: PLplot.xs, GD.xs, GD.c, INTERP.xs,
  RNG.xs, and RNG.c.

- Modern versions of MakeMaker (e.g. 6.22) fail to compile PDL, apparently
  because of the removal of the magic pm_to_blib target.  Current
  versions (such as 6.17, bundled with the current perl, v5.8.6) work OK. 
  With PDL 2.4.2, we have followed the core perl team in our use of
  earlier MakeMaker versions.  As of PDL 2.4.3 this may have been resolved.
  If it works for you, please let us know!  Thanks.

- PDL::Graphics::TriD doesn't seem to link correctly on the Mac, under 
  MacOS 10.5 & 10.6.  It has not been tested for the 2.4.3 release.  The
  TriD build has been cleaned so this problem may have been resolved.
  If you'd like to test/fix it, please do!  Patches welcome.
  (PDL::Graphics::TriD is disabled by default on Mac installs, edit
   the perldl.conf file if you wish to test this feature)

  point release:
