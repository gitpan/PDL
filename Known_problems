The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL. 

- Modern versions of MakeMaker (e.g. 6.22) fail to compile PDL, apparently
  because of the removal of the magic pm_to_blib target.  Current
  versions (such as 6.17, bundled with the current perl, v5.8.6) work OK. 
  With PDL 2.4.2, we have followed the core perl team in our use of
  earlier MakeMaker versions.

- FFTW 3.0.1 is now out but is not supported (yet). You can use 2.x versions
  of FFTW, fall back on the built-in fft routines, or (best of all) submit a 
  patch. 

- If @INC has '.' at the front of the search path part of the build will
  fail (specifically mkpdlconv will not be able to 'use English' since
  it uses Exporter.pm from Basic/Core and not the system Exporter.pm).

    [This appears to be fixed but this note is left FYI for the 2.4.2 release
	-- CED 16-Dec-2004 ]

- PDL::Graphics::TriD doesn't seem to link correctly on the Mac, under 
  MacOS 10.5 & 10.6.  It has not been fixed in part because TriD needs an 
  overhaul anyway, and in part because the code is cryptic.  If you'd like 
  to fix it, please do!  Patches welcome.  (PDL::Graphics::TriD is disabled
  by default on Mac installs, thanks, Doug)

- The t/fits.t test and PDL::IO::FITS module can show problems when
  used with old versions of the Astro::FITS::Header module. If you have
  problems then please install the latest version from

    http://search.cpan.org/~aallan/Astro-FITS-Header/

  (it is v2.8.1 at the time of writing) and see if this stops the problems.
  Note that Astro::FITS::Header has a somewhat esoteric numbering scheme
  (all the individual components have their own version number) which can
  make it hard to work out what version of  the package have installed.
