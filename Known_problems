The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- The default TriD controls are based on having at least
  a two button mouse.  For Macs with one button, you can use
  Ctrl+Click as a work around.


- VRML output driver does not work for PDL::Graphics::TriD


- FFTW 3.2.2 is the current release version of the FFTW library
  but is not yet supported by PDL::FFTW.  You may install version
  2.1.5 of FFTW which is supported, fall back to using the PDL's
  built-in fft routines (PDL::FFT), or submit a patch to update
  PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- Various make problems with build:
  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.
  - Make fails with message like

      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."

      If you have this error, please contact the PDL developers via the perldl
      mailing list and help us track this one down.  Thanks!


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output
  from configure, built, test process.


- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.


- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear
  to result from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode
  or uudecode.  Installing Convert::UU should resolve the problem.


- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp
  files can not be created.  This appears to be a result of platform
  misconfiguration of TEMPDIR.


- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to
  an older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit
  formats.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.4_136 point release:
