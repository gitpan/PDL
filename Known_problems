The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.1.3 is now out but is not supported by PDL::FFTW (yet).
  You can use version 2.1.5 of FFTW, fall back on the built-in
  fft routines, or (best of all) submit a patch. 

- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  configure, built, test process.  This can be confusing for first
  time users.

- There is a problem on some Solaris systems where the t/pic_16bit
  test fails apparently due to a bug in that system's pnmtopng.

- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.

- PDL::Graphics::TriD is in the process of being refactored.
  Only minor fixes have occurred since PDL-2.4.3.  Please check
  for releases of PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl for the new implementation.

- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the 2.4.4
  point release:

  2153898    default PDL build output too long
  1994610    TriD build problem w pthreads
