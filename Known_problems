The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:

- If you have a pre-existing PDL install in your perl @INC path,
  mysterious failures have been observed in some tests due to
  unintentionally pulling in a previous version of PDL.  The
  'perl Makefile.PL' stage now checks for this and asks if you
  wish to continue [default is yes].
  
  *Usually* continuing with another PDL in the path will work
  BUT if you get mysterious test failures, try removing the
  previous PDL install files and test/build again.


- The PDL build process also checks for white space in the build
  directory as that is known to cause problems for some modules
  and prompts if you wish to continue [default is yes].

  You can avoid the interactive prompts by setting the
  environment variable PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT to true (e.g., 1).
  That will force the default options to be taken.  The
  warnings will still be printed to remind you in case the
  PDL build fails at a later stage.


- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.12 has a new
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to make an
  explicit temp as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;

  becomes

    my $tmp; # work around perl -d "feature"
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;

  The problem is understood and it is hoped that an official
  fix will become available soon.  NOTE: the work around is
  100% effective---but ugly.


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- PDL::FFTW is based on version 2 of the FFTW API.  The current
  release of the FFTW library is version 3.2.2.  To use PDL::FFTW
  you will need to install FFTW version 2.1.5, use the built-in 
  PDL::FFT routines instead, or (better yet) submit a patch to
  update PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- Various make command issues during build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail; so don't use -j # options.

  - make fails with message like.
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
    The cause is unknown.  If you have this problem, *please* let the developers
    know via the perldl mailing list.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- Directory completion in the interactive PDL shells (perldl and pdl2)
  using Term::ReadLine::Perl adds a space after each directory expansion.
  To continue to complete, one must delete the space before typing <TAB>
  again.  The problem has been reported as a Term::ReadLine::Perl bug.


- PDL on Cygwin has (by default) a 300MB process memory limit which can
  cause out of memory crashes with large data sets.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.7_009 release:
