This directory contains development efforts for a new and
improved perldl shell (Perldl2) that can integrate with
the Padre IDE to support PDL development.

You need to install the version 1.003011 of Devel::REPL
in order to build/use the Perldl2 shell. A description
of the files in this directory and how to install and
use the Perldl2 shell follows.

|                      INSTALLATION                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  By default, the Perldl2 shell is always built and
  installed.  To disable this, edit the WITH_DEVEL_REPL
  option in the perldl.conf file.

  You will need to install Devel::REPL version 1.003011
  or greater to run pdl2.

|                           USE                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  To use the Perldl2 shell, from the PDL build directory
  run the following:

    perl -Mblib Perldl2/pdl2

  If you have installed the just built PDL, you should
  be able to run:

    pdl2

 To exit the Perldl2 shell from the PDL> prompt, type Ctrl-D
 or quit, q, x, or exit.

+-----------------------------------------------------------+

 Supported functionality from Devel::REPL and PDL:
  * DDS (pretty prints output using Data::Dump::Streamer)
  * History (redo commands with !-1 and !<num> syntax)
  * Interrupt (interrupt with Ctrl-C; not on MSWin32)
  * LexEnv (e.g., my $a = zeros(10) works)
  * MultiLine::PPI (handles multiline input like perldl)
  * NiceSlice (PDL::NiceSlice works too!)
  * Packages (keeps track of current user package)
  * PDLCommands (perldl shell v1 convenience routines)
  * ReadLineHistory
    * Save and restore command history to file
  * CompletionDrivers
    * Globals  (completion for globals) 
    * INC      (completion for use module::name)
    * Keywords (completion for perl keywords)
    * LexEnv   (completion for lexical vars)
    * Methods  (completion of method names)

 Default PDL modules loaded:
  * PDL
  * PDL::Dbg
  * PDL::Doc::Perldl
  * PDL::IO::Dumper
  * PDL::IO::FlexRaw
  * PDL::IO::Pic
  * PDL::Image2D
  * PDL::AutoLoader

 ? and ?? aliases for help and apropos now work
 
 Arguments to help|usage|apropos|sig|badinfo|demo are not autoquoted

 Shell escapes starting with $PERLDL::ESCAPE as the first character
 of a line now work.

 l <num> prints the last num lines of history, default 20.

 p is an alias for print.

 demo works but at the end of the demo, you may need to type Ctrl-D
 if it hangs after the final "press enter" prompt (Ctrl-Z then Enter
 for win32 perls).

 The Perldl2 shell, pdl2, now loads/saves from the same
 history file as perldl. This is a new feature so, as
 always, feedback welcome.

 The Perldl2 shell, pdl2, now loads your .perldlrc file
 from the same location as the perldl shell does.  It also
 accepts .pdlrc as the name---looking forward to the new
 naming scheme for the interactive shell.  A local.pdlrc
 or local.perldlrc are run if present as well.  As always,
 feedback is welcome.
