	  (GNU Scientific Library) package. 
	- Patch to compile under perl5.005_57
	- Patch to add an interface to the FFTW
	  library. (A free C FFT library including
          multi-dimensional, real, and parallel transforms)

Christian Soller
	- Patch to add 'any' and 'all' functions to use for comparison
          operations. (e.g. This enables things like ($pdl->any == 3.2)
           or $pdl->all > 0 )
	- Patch to picnorgb test to fix greyscale and rgb 
          generation on some platforms.

	- Patch to Basic/Core/Basic.pm to fix bug in 
          centre=> when operating on pre-existing array.

          requires File::Spec since PDL2.002)
	- Removed of ExtUtils::F77 from the distribution.
          Added ExtUtils::F77 to the PREREQ_PM list.
          (ExtUtils::F77 is already on CPAN separately.
           Having it also distributed with PDL causes
           confusion.)
        - Fixed cumuprodover docs to be similar to
          cumusumover.
	- Fixed typo in squaretotri function. (na
	  changed to mna)

Doug Burke:
	- Patch to iis.pd to allow the user
          to change the title of an image
          displayed with iis().
	- Patch to IO/Misc/misc.pd:
	    1) Added option PERLCOLS so you can now read
               in columns into perl arrays at the same
               time as reading in data into piddles.

	    2) Changed the meaning of the 'c' parameter
               in the LINES option. It will only affect
               you if you use LINES together with 
               INCLUDE/EXCLUDE.

	    3) It now complains if you forget to surround
                patterns by //

	     4) It will also warn you (if $PDL::verbose is true)
                if no data is read in from a file.
	- Patch to PP.pod docs to clearup PRIV/CODE usage.

        - Updated Christian Soeller's email address in all files.
        - Clarified docs on the RMS element returned by the stats
          function.
	- Changed how $PDL::VERSION is set so CPAN will pick it
          up correctly:
           * PDL::VERSION is now set directly in PDL.pm
	   * Makefile.PL reads $PDL::VERSION from PDL.pm and
	     auto-generates Basic/Version.pm 

Joshua Pritikin: Changes for compatibility with PDL-Objstore.
	Includes all the fairly conservative changes. More radical
	changes to come.
	- Deals with portability between perl versions using Devel-PPPort.
	- Adds a version number to the PDL API.

	- Patch to slices.pd to export the dice and dice_axis
	  functions.

Robert Schwebel
	- Patch for the "perldl" shell that does the following:

Christian Soeller:
	- Commented out the close(STDERR) lines in pnd.pd to fix a 
	  problem where the output from a 'die' is not seen for 
	  certain test cases after using rpic/wpic from PDL::IO::Pic.
	- Misc Patch:
		- negative positions for dummy
  		- matmult now also supports promotion to sig dims
  		- PDL::matmult naming corrected

Doug Burke:
	- Patch to clean up some of the PGPLOT documentation.

Harry Felder:
	- Patch to Basic/Math/Makefile.PL to not depend on PWD 
  	  environment variable.

	  which controls how undefs are treaded when a PDL
	  is created from a perl structure using
	  pdl(), float(), double(), etc.

Tim Jenness:
	- Change to perldl to accept -w flag. This runs perldl

	  to imag, the 1-element dimensions will be ignored. It also
          checks that the piddle doesn't get too small, so that 
          if you input a (100, 1, 1, 1) image, it will be 
          treated as a (100,1) image by PGPLOT.

          converters
	- Modified PDL.pm PDL::Lite.pm , PDL::LiteF.pm so that the $VERSION would

	- PP.pm and PP.pod additions for subclassing.
	- Minor Change to Html.pm to correct problem with it 
	  creating false html references from .pod text that contained
	  '=head' as examples.
	- Updates to Doc/mkhtmldoc.pl to fix most problems with html documents
	  not referencing each other correctly. In order to not change multiple
          .pod documents and documentation in .pm files, html docs will now be
          installed in ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs/PDL instead of 
	  ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs. (If installing over a previous version,
	  the html files in .../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs should be deleted to
 	  avoid confusion.

Robin Williams:
	- FFT test file addition (t/fft.t)
	  (Test number 2 fails... commented-out for now)

Andy Dougherty, John Cerney
	- Changes to compile with perl5.005

Anton Berezin:

   GenericTypes only.
Robin:
 - TriDGallery: game of life! (edited by Tjl)
Karl:
 - new karma.pd
 - reshape patch
 - callext patch

1.9904 (2.0 try 2)

1.9902
Tjl:
 - fix pdlcore.c to work with MAGIC hashes, to enable really
   wild constructions to come
 - twiddle with flexraw.t
 - PP cleanup: let 'SIZE' be used in RedoDimsCode. (needs to be cleaned
   up from the other kind of access to this.. also need '$PDL(a)')
 - null = just flag, so 0-dimensions are now allowed.
 - allow which to take other types for mask as well... - required
   cleaning PP to make RedoDimsCode be parsed just like Code, except
   without threadloop. Seems to work nicely.
   (I needed to take ($a == byte 5)->which for a large byte $a and
   was horrified to find that my program grew to dozens of Mb)
   !!! Note: possible incompatibility: before a floating value 0<v<1
   would be interpreted as false, now true - but more logical this
   way.
 - where to take multiple arguments before the mask,
   to map them all through the mask.
 - add 'isnull' to Core.xs
 - Basic/Gen/PP/PDLCode.pm to 'use strict', just in case...
 - add 'Config.pm' to help with tests
    - flexraw.t to use this
    - Makefile.PLs to set the results of the tests.
    - Maybe add PDL::Config_user later to store original
      config hash values from user.
 - threadover to clear NOMYDIMS flag.
Raphael:
 - Callext fixes for hp-ux, required an interface change !!!
TODO:

   places just use that, especially the tests..

1.9901
Christian:

    'output ' with 'print' in the printouts; beginners might be confused
    by the 'output' abstraction)
  - new demo '3dgal' for the TriD Gallery
  - install PDL::Graphics::VRML::Protos in the correct place
  - fixed picrgb test to generate a warning when broken

 - Remove PCARout & PCA, as not really useful in present form !!!
Robin:
 - mconf.h osf warnings patch

1.96_01

 - TJL's jumbo patch
     - stuff into Basic/Math
     - TriD/MathGraph, for display of graphs in three
       dimensions, by finding an appropriate representation
       via a molecular dynamics-type search
 - Christian's clipping patch
 - set -ve indice patch
 - added my wcols() to PDL::IO::Misc
 - Lite.pm bug (Shawn)
 - Robin's mconf.h patch and Kaj's erfi.t test inserted
 - Christians type() patch
 - Christians const.c patch for IRIX
 - added Christian's COPYING suggestion
 - heroically went through and changed all the copyright messages
   on the docs to conform to the new standard
 - fixed (c) notice in Core.pm docs, others still need to be
   done
 - better explanation of GenericTypes and Pars in PP.pod
 - improved scantree.pl (portable cwd).
 - HTML docs!! - thanks to Christian's mkhtmldoc.pl (some changes)
   into the distribution. included a hacked Pod::Html (from perl
   5.004) as PDL::Pod::Html Still not great but gives us something
   to work from. Some links still broken - patches welcome. See
   file:/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/PDL/HtmlDocs
   for docs after 'make install'
 - TJL's average() patch and primitive.t patch
 - Docs now only built during 'make install' or 'make doctest'
   (which builds them under ./blib), this saves them being built
   unnecessarily during 'make'
 - PDL::Slatec now works on any system with a f77 compiler.
   All unused slatec functions were got rid of which fortunately
   removed all the ones with COMPLEX arguments. Also changed
   prototype generation which removes warnings on build.
   Added local copy of ExtUtils::F77 back into dist and WITH_SLATEC
   option to perldl.conf (undef by default for auto-decision).
 - removed Example/PP - out of date


1.95_07

 - applied Christian's mega-patch - but there were problems
   I had to fix manually.
   (a) his maga-patch didn't include the patch to pdl.h he had
       already made.
   (b) the change should have been made to pdl.h.PL in any case.
 - fixed NAME in Indexing.pod
 - may have fixed executable install problem of 'perldl' shell
 - fixed PDL.pm being lost from docs db
 - Robin's problems 'compiling pdl 1.54_06 Basic/Math' patch 17/12/97

   Rejected because of following error (Linux/gcc)

     const.c:80: parse error before `3.14159265358979323846'
     const.c:99: parse error before `__extension__'
     const.c:99: parse error before `}'

   Can the patch be revised?

 - Robin's at() accepts -ve indices patch. Can we have set() to?
 - removed 'docscan' and 'pdlhead2item' from MANIFEST - OK ?

1.95_06

  KGB

  - FITS patch
  - restored cc8compt fibonacci from pdl-porters archive (!)
  - fixed misc module name problems in tests (thanks Bob!)
  - Robin and Christian's help patches
  - Robin's Object.pod patch
  - Achim: chmod 0755 on Doc/*.PL,
  - Achim wanted pdldoc.db in archlib, ignored this (don't understand
    why)
  - put fudge in ops.pd to get rid of that stupid compiler warning
    with abs() and byte/ushort types
  - rebuilt MANIFEST hope it is OK now

  - introduced new barf(...) routine in Core.pm and pdlcore.c
    [see help barf]

    we should use barf(...) in C and Perl code instead of croak etc.

    Note the barf engine is written in Perl, so is easy to customize!

  - changed references to 'croak' in pd/xs/c code to barf(..)
    or Perl_croak where appropriate
  - changed references to 'croak' in various .pm files to barf()
    where appropriate
  - croak #defined to barf() in pdlcore.h to catch the use in
    xsubpp (..fingers crossed..). Perhaps future xsubpp will allow
    an override of this.

  - renamed PDL::Io:: heirarchy PDL::IO:: for consistency with Perl IO::

1.95_05

  KGB

  - Renamed PDL.pdl_make_physical PDL.make_physical (woops!) - ditto
    physdims().

  - Changed type config. Now Types.pm pdl.h pdlsimple.h are generated
    AUTOMATICALLY from Types.pm.PL pdl.h.PL and pdlsimple.h.PL
    files using perl Config information. int size issue is now handled
    from perl config information. Lots of potential for more flexibility.
    Hope this doesn't break Alpha stuff by mistake!

  - Revised PDL::CallExt. Now uses make_physical rather than PP and allows
    unlimited args in the same way as PDL-1.11. Ought to be more compiler
    friendly too! Put callext.t back.

  - Added 'dog' and 'cat'

1.95_04

  KGB

  - Added glEnable/DisableClientState to dontfunc in OpenGL
  - Doug: added fake MAIN_ to cfft.f in Slatec for old g77s
  - Achim's patches of 4/12
  - my IIS changes
  - Robin's random and Inf/NaN patches of 4/12
  - Christian:  'minor doc polishing Core.pm+primitive.pd'
  - Christian: INSTALL patches.
  - Christian: 'docs in Doc/Doc/Perldl.pm'
  - Robin's minor perldl docs patch
  - Restored my missing hist() patch and test of Oct 10th (sic)
  - Achim's suggestions on help 'help' and help 'perldl', '?' and
    allow no quotes (with warning)
  - Added solaris_2 hints file for OpenGL
  - Robins perldl pod patches but NOT 'l' as a synonym for 'last'
    (I don't like this as 'last' is a perl keyword)

1.95_03

  KGB:

  - Various small changes to TriD/test*.pl scripts. Renamed as *.p
  - minor TriD changes to comply with new zeroes() etc.
  - moved tests all into one top level t/ directory.
  - corrected PDL::initialise and convert (Christian)
  - Robin's primitive.pd patch
  - callext.t temporarily disabled - I will rewrite the module.
  - Minor changes to 'Doc'.
  - TriD renamed to PDL::Graphics::TriD

1.95_02 [emergency bug fixing release]

 KGB:

 - Redid all the zeroes/ones/[xyrz]vals/[g]random/sequence stuff
   someone please please give me some objective advice :-)
 - Added Robin's new FFT
 - 3 byte change to Pnm.pm for new zeroes()
 - added make_physical and make_physdims to PDL struct

1.95_01

KGB:

 - Added Cephes code to PDL::Math as backup, changed signature of
   jn, yn.
 - changed scalar convesion in pdlcore.c SvPDLV() - '2.0' is now
   double, '2' is now int. [Uses SvNOK SvIOK etc] - changed
   Basic/t/conv.t to comply.
 - Added magic {PDL} = code ref hook. And put test/example in
   subclass.t
 - random() is now like zeroes() and both allow type/dim and
   $x template arguments. New arg proc. method to support this.
 - Added grandom().
 - Ressurected PDL::Exporter (q.v.). Much simpler than bizarrity
   in PDL-1.11. Now 'use PDL::Mod' defaults to loading ':Func'.
   Provision for noimports. Less typing!!!! Modified docs too.
 - Renamed PDL::Graphics::PG PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
 - Reverted to manpages named PDL::FAQ.1, PDL::Dataflow.1, etc.
   This is simpler and maintains consistence between manpage
   and pod browsers. Fixed all the text links to comply.
 - small changes to Pod/ docs.
 - shut PP the hell up! Much less scary build now.
 - added Pods to files scanned in building doc database.
 - [xvyz]rvals now act like zeroes - but they now act like
    constructos so $derived->xvals does not give you what
    you expect. Need to think about this some more.

1.94_09

KGB: NOTE ONE MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE [random]

 - removed PDL_OPTIONS - PDL_CONFIG for everything. I think this is
   better, e.g. if we want debugging we can add Debugging=>1 to
   %PDL_CONFIG.
 - changed use of PDL_CONFIG - see INSTALL. I think this is simpler.
 - made Karma conform with above - and simplified.
 - changed Callext arg limit to 10 to avoid compiler explosions.
 - integrated PDL::Doc, created PDL::Doc::Perldl.
 - manifying is now back from the .pm file rather then the .pd
   (this is a better design now pod are semi-generated from PP)
 - Christian's patches of 25/11/97:
   'Core.xs and pdlapi.c'
   'test' for Io::Pic
 - added docs for Doc field in PP.pod and made one-line a special case
 - Moved statistical functions from Basic.pm to Primitive.pm
 - Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lotsof miscellaneous docs.
 - Robin's browser patch of 26/11
 - Core now completely OO - i.e. none of the stuff below Basic/ export
   routines to each other and it still works!
 - changed occurences of foo(sig) to use '=for sig' as this seems to
   work better with Pod::Parser.
 - made random $x=random($y), i.e. to get inplace now random(inplace $y)
   OK?????????? This is because I think it is natural to say
   $r = random(zeroes(10,20,2)), etc.
   If this is a major headache let me know and I will change it back.
 - Docs => undef allowed - no PP docs at all (not even the sig)
 - Various changes to Docs.pm and Docs::Perldl.pm - apropos text searches
   now include module names and one-line desriptions. God I love this
   language.
 - Renamed Iutil module as ImageRGB - hope this is OK???
 - changed name of 'inv' to 'matinv' in Slatec for consistency
   with matmult in Primitive.

1.94_06

Christian:
  - lots of things.
Robin:
  - add type to PdlParObj.pm
Achim (req):
  - Version to Core.pm
Tjl:
  - New configuration.

1.94_05
... Not recorded. Real threading for example.

1.94_02

Lots of changes by everyone, e.g. FFT, Browser, ...

1.94_01

Christian:
  - simplescaler
  - VRML !!!

Achim:
  - misc.t patch
  - Browser hints

Karl:
  - autocreation memleak patch

Robin:
  - flexraw test correction

Jarle:
  - Ops.pd: prevent creation of -0

Tuomas:
  - Core bug fixes for e.g. $a->slice("...")->index(...) .= foo,
    originally reported by Christian.
  - mandel.pl demo

Others??

1.94

Kgb:
  - Autoload patch
  - subclass fixes: pdl_destroy + test.
  - sethdr + gethdr ref counts
  - rfits/wfits update

Christian:
  - where etc.
  - imag3d without lines

Kaj Wiik:
  - tsimp.pl use correction

Achim:
  - Tk patch

Tjl:
  - Change PP.pm to really allow Pars => 'a(tri=>3)' to happen.
    Embarrassingly, this was a one-liner.
  - OpenGL libs changed to take both GL and MesaGL.
  - openglq.pd: use tri=3
  - rout.pd ditto
  - TriD.pm: documentation updates & 'LINE' as context
  - Graph.pm: coordinate axes labels!
  - test7.pl: some niceties.
  - make the thread incs etc. into register variables.
    this should, with a good compiler, result in some speedup.
  - primitive.pd: histogram -> histogram + whistogram,
    more thread-friendly.
  - correct foo.t
  - TriD: add imag3d_ns (no surface) and minor twiddling.

1.93_06

Kgb:
  - PP: use PDLOBJ for the stub subs.
  - Basic.pm: sec, ins fixes - use "int" to ensure type of coords.
  - PG.pm fixes
  - IIS fixes

Achim:
  - ws fixes for docs, pptest.t
  - "small perldl fixes"

Tjl:
  - start making support for piddle-controlled (e.g. affine)
    transformations by using magic.
  - Core.xs: setdims should now work with dataflow properly.
  - Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h, PP.pm: add support for
    foofunctions and PDL::Trans objects. These are a very basic way
    of accessing the internals of transformations so that
    in the future, as the mechanism is improved,
    you can e.g. change your slice from outside.
    The current level of support is enough to make a routine
    that takes a slice of one dimension and is given offset and
    increment and n in that.
  - TriD:
     - add test8.pl to demonstrate an use of foofunctions.
     - document OpenGLQ and Rout
     - add gl_triangles_n for shaded triangles
     - TriD.pm:
        - realcoords: add more contexts
        - make the default routines all plot a graph
     - GL.pm:
        - add glPolygonOffset call to GL::Window in order to
	  get good-looking imag3d always
	- change the colors to somewhat lighter ones.
	- delete_viewports -> clear_viewports (like clear_objects)
	- new argument to twiddle
     - Graph.pm:
        - default names for dataseries
	- waffle less
	- support changed dataseries
     - Image.pm:
        - use realcoords COLOR context
     - Lines.pm:
        - start deprecation by renaming package
     - Objects.pm:
        - realcoords support better by r_type
	- waffle less
	- SLattice_S to draw shaded lattices
	- tests changed somewhat.
  - Core.xs: remove pdl_unpackint unnecessarity
  - Basic.pm: make axisvals return zeroes if not enough dimensions.
  - Opt/Simplex/Simplex.pm: add support for temperature a la
    Numerical Recipes.
  - (Christian) - remove Data::Dumper from FastRaw.

1.93_05

Tjl:
  - PP: several changes, basically inline *size and *incs into
    register variables to speed up execution.
  - TriD:
     - add TriD/Rout for misc C routines for TriD
        - add a routine to do flowing combination of 3 piddles into
          coordinates or colours
     - this makes the test3.pl data_changed stuff work again.
     - imagrgb now defaults to a whole-window image - no reason
       to make it rotatable with the mouse.

1.93_04

Tjl:
  - TriD: add stuff for Tk
    - OpenGL: ConnectionNumber
    - ButtonPress + Release: more info back
    - TriD.pm: add export imagrgb
    - Control3D: small changes + TriD::Tk::post_menu
    - GL.pm: ConnectionNumber support for Tk eventloop
    - Graph.pm: minor changes
    - Image.pm: major changes, make multi-D images actually work.
      also, support for different multi-D background color.
***** NOTE: calling convention now same as with coordinates!
      this means an incompatible change.
    - added Tk.pm, rudimentary support for a menu of actions
      associated with the displayed 3D graph. Currently, can save
      the image.
    - test3.pl: change to new imagrgb calling sequence.
    - GoBoard.pm: ditto
    - test6.pl: test the Tk functionality.
    - testimg.pl: really test the multidimensional picture facility
      with an 8-D tricolor picture.
  - Io/Pnm/Pic.pm: use the new 'Func' convention
  - perldl.PL: new '-tk' option to use Tk and the Tk event loop.

1.93_03

Tjl:
  - TriD:
     - Change default controller to ArcCone
     - Graphs with axes!
  - PP:
     - EquivDimCheck now honoured
  - iis.pd: #undef Generic
  - OpenGL/Makefile.PL update + generate.PL tuning
  - Browse: manpage twiddle

1.93_02

Tjl:
  - Core/Basic.pm: use PDL::Core qw/:Func/;
  - Core/Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h: hdr stuff (untested)
  - Core/Core.xs: bugfix threadover_n to make_physical
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_destroy will not destroy if an affine trans the
    child of which hasn't been allocated exists.
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_changed will not try to do overeager
    optimization. Fixes flow.t bug
  - Basic/t/flow.t: enable again the tests that now work.
  - Gen/PP.pm: new '$a = inner($b,$c)' changes.
  - Slices/slices.pd: splitdim checks arguments
  - Basic/t/thread.t: semi-add new test
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGL: new PDL::OpenGL module to enable virtualization
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGLQ: a test for TriD virtualization of OpenGL,
    this will later on expand a lot
  - Graphics/TriD/TriD.pm & TriD/*: new docs, small changes.
  - Io/Fastraw/FastRaw.pm: don't waffle when mmapping
  - MANIFEST.SKIP: add more ignorable stuff

KGB:

  - Fixed multiple 'use PDL' etc problem for loaders.
  - "use 5.004"

1.93_01 (Kgb) MAJOR CHANGES

- these are very significant and affect code throughout the
  system so EXPECT problems. In particular note that this code
  is the new PATCHBASE.

- NEW IMPORT/EXPORT system

  PDL_OO.pm now deleted.

  PDL::Exporter is DEAD and gone!! (hooray)

  All modules now define their functions in package PDL.

  The idea is a PDL::Module now looks like this:

    package PDL::Module;

    @EXPORT_OK  = qw( sub1 sub2 ...);
    %EXPORT_TAGS = (Func=>[@EXPORT_OK]);

    @ISA    = qw( Exporter ... );

    *sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;
    sub PDL::sub1 { ... def ...}

    # If you wanted to do something special (e.g. a constructor) you can:

    sub rfits(PDL->rfits(@_)); # This gets exported
    sub PDL::rfits {
      my $class = shift;
      # etc...
    }

  i.e. the onus is entirely on the module writer.

  Thus saying 'use PDL::Module' will load (cheaply) PDL methods.
  If you want to (less cheaply) import functions say 'use PDL::Module qw/:Func/'

  PP has been modified to generate modules which follow this scheme. i.e. by
  default it stuffs its functions in to the PDL namespace, and writes stubs
  '*sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;' into the PM file. This can be changed at whim
  however.  There is a new pp function - pp_bless('MyObj') which  will change the
  default package from "PDL" to 'MyObj' in anticipation of future
  Object-Oriented PP modules. (Up to the author how he writes his module).
  Also the pp_def(PMFunc=>'...') attribute can be used to generate special
  purpose PM code instead of the default.

  Comments please, hopefully nice ones as I have spent all day changing
  code everywhere and debugging!!!

  - Karl (exhausted)


- Module defaults

  PDL.pm now loads a set of standard packages (with :Func) - including graphics
  and I/O for TPJ article and v1.11 compatibility. Thus a script with 'use PDL'
  is v1.11 compatible (modulo bug fixes!)

  Lite.pm loads only the truly fundametal core, with no imports, for method
  speed freaks. Thus a lean script need only say 'use PDL::Lite' plus whatever
  else it needs.

  I hope various other sets of meta-modules (PDL::Astronomy, PDL::Medical) etc
  will follow this simple scheme. Basically there is nothing sacred about
  'use PDL' anymore - it is just one of many loaders.

- perldl shell

  The 'perldl' script sources C<~/.perldlrc> if present or falls back to
  C<PDL/default.perldlrc>. The latter just does the standard 'use PDL'

  Thus by creating a C<~/.perldlrc> you are free to 'use PDL::Lite' or
  whatever set of modules you fancy without impinging on v1.11 compatibility.

  I think this is a rather elegant solution to all our aesthetic tastes
  (namespace polluters vs method maniacs, module hoarders vs leany
  meanies) while still ensuring script compatibility with v1.11.

  I hope everyone is happy with this!

- Fixed minor bug in FlexRaw
