    Avoid lvalue sub syntax requirements
    
    For perl 5.6.x perls, we have occaisional test failures in PDL
    due to lvalue sub errors.  This fixes a number of occurances where
    we were using the lvalue syntax when we do not officially require
    it---maybe we should.  In the meantime, this cleans up a number of
    refs and updates the FAQ entry to be more correct.

    Make Data::Dumper v 2.121 the minimum required
    
    The earlier 2.122 was too aggressive.  It appears that the
    needed fix was in version 2.121.

    Rework storable test to use Test::More
    
    Updated t/storable.t to check for Storable version 1.03
    rather than 1.0 since the comments in PDL::IO::Storable
    suggested that that was the version required.  While at
    it, updated the test to use Test::More.

    Fix t/autoload.t test when echo ~ gives ~
    
    On some systems, the shell returns '~' as the result of qx{echo ~}
    which causes a spurious test failure.  In that case, check against
    the original reference value of (getpwnam(getpwuid(\$<)))[7] .
    This is more permissive but is a correct answer for tilde expansion
    so works as a pass check.

    Set minimum Data::Dumper version to 2.122
    
    This is the first version of Data::Dumper that looks
    like it addresses the problem I found.  Since Data::Dumper
    was "used" by PDL::IO::Dumper, it should have been listed
    as a dependency for PDL.  Requiring this version prevents
    testing with the broken ones.

    We were using it to implement PDL::IO::Dumper so it should
    have been listed.  By listing it, the automated testers
    will report version numbers with failing test reports which
    might help resolve the current FAILs with t/dumper.t

    Add Changes to the .gitignore
    
    Telling git to ignore the Changes file for now since we'll
    be automatically generating it from the output of a "git log --stat"
    for each CPAN distribution.  Anyone who is doing actual development
    with PDL can just use the git log command directly.  Any official or
    developers release on CPAN will have a generated log file.
    
    For now, the old logs pre-git are now in Changes_CVS and the Changes
    file will include git log since the changeover.  At some point, we
    could deprecate the Changes_CVS file and just go to the git logs.

    command eventually.  For now, just generate by hand before making
    a CPAN distribution.

    Make tilde test check against `echo ~` result
    
    Since the goal is to give the same result as the
    shell (i.e. bash) expansion of ~, and since all the
    false test failures had the PDL::AutoLoader giving
    the same result as `echo ~`, I've just made that
    the result to check against.

    Instead of specifying LIBS=>[] (on those occasions when LIBS

    Fix readflex() to work with File::LinearRaid
    
    readflex() in IO/FlexRaw/FlexRaw.pm use method syntax for
    read with an input file handle.  This failed with a tied

    I don't know if it should have worked the other way or not.

    The $PDL::VERSION is changed to 2.4.4_05git for more

    development release for a given version, say 2.4.4_05
    is the same base with the string 'git' added on the
    end.  When the release is made, the git suffix is
    removed and the distribution gnerated from there.

    The podselect command is a perl script and is

    sets PERL5OPT to load Devel::AutoFlush which
    is a problem if that module is not in the
    default, system perl @INC.

    Added friendly .perldlrc suggsetion to perldl docs
    
    A user suggested recommending documentation for new perldl
    users on starting from the default.perldlrc file.  This
    avoids some mistakes such as forgetting to "use PDL;" etc.

    Add cast toe $GENERIC(a) for setvaltonan()
    
    This fixes the case where it was not possible to
    set the value to bad for a non-double piddle since
    it was difficult/impossible to create the exact
    floating point representation of some floats starting
    from default doubles.  This make the implementation
    symmetric with that of setbadtoval().

    Make PDL require perl 5.6.2 or above.
    
    CPAN Testers have *no* PASS's on record for any
    version of PDL for perl 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.  This
    modification makes that more explicit in the
    configuration process.  This is effectively a NO-OP.

    c git instructions, which I'll see if are correct during this push.

    Fix t/proj_transform to skip when no earth_image()
    
    Missing jpegtopnm functionality in NetPBM or other
    causes earth_image() to fail on some platforms.
    This modifies the test to skip the remaining tests
    if earth_image() can not be loading.  NOTE: we should
    add better config and tests for the Pic and Pnm
    image routines.

    Added ../Basic/Core to @INC for BAD demo builds
    
    The build process for the bad value demos used
    PDL::Config to determine if badvals were enabled.
    Since Config.pm is not installed until after the
    compiles, this caused build failures on some systems.
    I'm not sure why it didn't happen more often.
    Now we have "use lib '../Basic/Core'" which should
    make things work here.

    Fixed trylink() error on temp file failure
    
    Added 'trylink: ' to the file open error message
    in trylink() from Basic/Core/Dev.pm to allow for
    better debugging.  There may be a problem with
    $PDL::Config{TEMPFILE} generation that gives bad
    results for some configurations.

    hope this will allow me to track down an ongoing
    earth_image() failure in CPAN testing.

    Improved diagnostics and granularity of tests
    
    This was in response to a failure of this test
    in CPAN automated testing.  It was unclear from the
    test output what or from where the problem was
    coming.  This adds a couple more checks that should
    help us locate the problem.

    the number of elements in the piddle is zero and
    barfs appropriately.
