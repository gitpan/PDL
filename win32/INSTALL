Installing on Win32
-------------------

It's dead easy !!

First up - if you don't want to accept a "default" build of PDL, edit (the
self-documenting) perldl.conf accordingly. You'll find that file in the top
level folder.

To Build with MinGW compiler (on both MinGW-built and MSVC-built perl)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) You can get MinGW from http://www.mingw.org. Simplest way to install
   is to download the latest MinGW '.exe' from the Download page, and
   then run the downloaded executable to install MinGW into the location
   of your choice.

2) If you want to build PDL with Slatec support, install ExtUtils::F77-1.15
   (or later) from CPAN.

3) If (and only if) 'perl -V:cc' reports 'cl', then install ExtUtils::FakeConfig.

4) If (and only if) you installed ExtUtils::FakeConfig run:
    set perl5opt=-MConfig_m

5) 'cd' to the top level PDL source directory and run, in succession:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install
    (Instead of 'make', specify whatever it is that 'perl -V:make' reports - which,
    it's assumed, will be either 'nmake' or 'dmake'.)



To Build with MSVC compiler (MSVC-built perl only)
--------------------------------------------------

 The capability of building Slatec with f2c and associated
 libraries libi77.lib and libf77.lib probably still exists.
 If you want to use f2c you need to edit win32/win32f77.pl to
 reflect the location of f2c, the libs and the include file f2c.h.
 You'll also need to run:
    perl Makefile.PL F77CONF=win32/win32f77.pl
 instead of simply:
    perl Makefile.PL

 However, the instructions that follow assume that Slatec support is
 being provided by MinGW's fortran compiler (g77.exe):

1) If you want Slatec you need to install MinGW - this is for the g77.exe fortran
   compiler and libs. (See the preceding section for the link to MinGW.)
   You also need to install ExtUtils::F77-1.15 (or later) from CPAN.
   If you're not interested in Slatec, then there's no need to install either
   ExtUtils::F77 or MinGW.

2) 'cd' to the top level PDL source directory and run, in succession:
    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake test
    nmake install
