Installing on Win32
===================
To install via ppm for Strawberry Perl and ActiveState Perl:

First up install Astro::FITS::Header by running:

  ppm install Astro-FITS-Header


Then install the OpenGL, PGPLOT and PDL modules from the uwinnipeg rep by running:

  For perl 5.8:
    ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/OpenGL.ppd
    ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/PGPLOT.ppd
    ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/PDL.ppd
  
  Or for perl 5.10:
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/10xx/OpenGL.ppd
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/10xx/PGPLOT.ppd
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/10xx/PDL.ppd
  
  Or for perl 5.12:
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/12xx/OpenGL.ppd
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/12xx/PGPLOT.ppd
    ppm install http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/12xx/PDL.ppd
  
(Note that the ActiveState ppm for PDL currently lacks some of
the functionality that is available in the above PDL ppm packages
from uwinnipeg.)

If you would like, instead, to build PDL from source, that's also easy!!

Certain parts of PDL (eg PDL::Slatec and PDL::Minuit) can't be built
without a fortran compiler.  In the docs that follow I call these parts
(somewhat loosely) "the fortran stuff".



To Build from Source
--------------------
1) You'll need a make utility and a compiler - dmake/MinGW provides
   best mileage.  To install them onto ActivePerl (if you don't
   already have them) simply:
   
   ppm install MinGW

2) Then run:

   cpan -i ExtUtils::F77    # Optional - this is for "the fortran stuff".
                            # This will fail if using a Microsoft Compiler
			    # (see "Other Options" below).
                            # This will also fail on Strawberry Perl
			    # (no fortran compiler)

   cpan -i PGPLOT           # Optional - for PGPLOT graphics support.
                            # This will # fail if pgplot can't be found.
			    # It will also fail if no Fortran compiler is
			    # found---simpler to install using ppm
			    # (see above).

   cpan -i OpenGL           # Optional - this is for PDL's TriD support.
                            # Also available via ppm (see above) if there
                            # is any problem building.

   cpan -i PDL              # Will first install any missing pre-requisites.

If it's a developer release that you're trying to install then you'll
need to specify the full distribution path info, e.g.:

   cpan -i CHM/PDL-2.4.6_015.tar.gz



Other Options
-------------
1) Using f2c instead of g77 (for "the fortran stuff")
 The capability of building "the fortran stuff" with f2c and
 associated libraries libi77.lib and libf77.lib probably still
 exists (but is untested by any of the current developers).

 If you want to use f2c you need to edit win32/win32f77.pl to
 reflect the location of f2c, the libs and the include file f2c.h.

 You'll also need to run:
    perl Makefile.PL F77CONF=win32/win32f77.pl
 instead of simply:
    perl Makefile.PL

2) Building a "non-default" PDL
 If you don't want to accept a "default" build of PDL, download
 the source from CPAN, extract it to some location, cd to that
 location and edit (the self-documenting) perldl.conf accordingly.

 Then run, in succession:

    perl Makefile.PL
    dmake test
    dmake install

 This enables building of such things as:
 a) PDL::IO::GD (needs the gd C library);
 b) PDL::GSL::* modules (needs the gsl C library);
 c) PDL::Graphics::PLplot (needs the plplot C library);
 d) PDL::GIS::Proj & PDL::Transform::Proj4 (needs the proj4 C library);
 e) PDL::FFTW (needs the fftw2 C library)

As of the release of PDL-2.4.7, all of this functionality will be provided
by the above mentioned ppm packages. The PDL-2.4.6 packages do not provide
the plplot and proj4 functionality.
