What follows is that task list and description of
the work planned for the upcoming PDL-2.4.7 release.

The main goal for this release is to have a baseline
PDL working on *all* PDL OS platforms: win32, macosx,
and linux/unix/bsd systems with support for 2D (via
PLplot) and 3D (via OpenGL/TriD) graphics.

|                     PDL-2.4.7 CRITICAL PATH                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   This section documents the top level tasks from
   the more detailed list below.  The first column
   of the line indicates the priority of that item
   (and those below it) for the PDL-2.4.7 release:

     R -- required for release to occur
     N -- nice to have but not mandatory
     no mark means same as super bullet or FYI
     D -- done

  Each item has some task description based on the
  current status.

  
R  Improve PDL usability for first time users

     Required

     A simple cpan or platform package install should
     work out of the box.  Maybe not all dependencies
     will be there but PDL should build with 2D and
     3D graphics support if possible.


R  Need to test PDL build/install from scratch
   
     Required

     Needs multiple testers capable of building PDL
     and willing to configure their system for a
     clean room run of the install process(es).

     We need to confirm that PDL-2.4.7 builds or
     installs completely from scratch on all PDL
     platforms by testing.  This includes starting
     from the vanilla system (OS platform) and
     getting and installing PDL the way a new user
     would.  CPAN/source builds as well as binary
     installs should be tested as possible.  Install
     notes will be used to update release docs.


R  Update PDL web site pages 

     Required

     This is well underway.


R  Review current documentation (underway)

     Required

     This is well underway.


R  Add/update platform install notes to PDL wiki
R  Add CPAN shell start-up info to PDL wiki or web page

     Required

     Recent list queries and new user discussions
     suggest that we need to revisit the beginner
     documentation for how to get started with PDL.
     We definitely need clear instructions for how
     to start from scratch with cpan to install
     PDL (verify on all PDL platforms).


R  Need PLplot and PDL::Graphics::PLplot to build all platforms

     Required
     
     Progress has been made by David and Rob on building
     PLplot and/or PDL::Graphics::PLplot for a number of
     platforms.  It appears that PLplot is build and
     buildable (manually) for all platforms and the PDL
     support works as well.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         Deferred to PDL-2.4.8                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

R  Complete Perldl2 shell:
D  * Fix demo to work with Perldl2
D  + Add prompt stripping for cut-and-paste support
N  * Fix Ctrl-C handling for win32 systems
L  * Add safe pdl allocation option to prevent OOM death

     Required (CHM has volunteered for this task)
     
     The essential pdl2 shell is working and will run
     with the new features if Devel::REPL is installed.
     Otherwise it falls back to the perldl shell.

     The remaining work here is cleanup of some minor
     issues, implement remaining perldl features for
     back compatibility and a couple of nice-to-haves
     in better Ctrl-C handling and avoiding fatal OOM
     errors when running interactively in win32....


R  Add support for improved 2D image display using OpenGL
D  * Move imag2d() into a module form
L  * Enable REPL and GUI simultaneous operations and event loops

     Required (CHM has volunteered for this task)

     CHM plans to move imag2d into a module form for the
     PDL-2.4.7 release.


N  Finish PDL::IO::ENVI module

     Nice to have

     Needs to be added as an IO module with tests.
     A basic writeenvi routine needs to be completed.


N  New pdl() constructor with matlab [] syntax for string arguments

     Required

     The new pdl constructor handling of string arguments
     with MATLAB style array syntax is in the git PDL.
     The remaining work is cleaning up the test suite
     and fixing a couple of edge cases for the release.

     Ideally we should be able to cut-n-paste the print
     output of a piddle into the constructor as a
     string and get the piddle back (modulo float format).


N  Document how to set up a local sandbox for PDL build

     Nice to have

     A number of PDL users are configuring their
     own local library, perl, and PDL installations.
     It would be nice if clear directions were
     written down so everyone doesn't have to
     reinvent the same wheel.


N  Finish spheres3d implementation

     Nice to have (CHM has volunteered for this task)

     This involves completing support for color and radius
     parameters for the spheres and some minor cleanup.


N  How to install the CPAN Testers reporting packages

     Nice to have

     The new CPAN Testers version 2.0 has been
     released.  It uses a web-based interface to
     send reports rather than email.  As a result
     is is much easier to configure than the old
     interface.  As such, we would get better PDL
     feedback if we have a quick-start for that.


N  Update PDL Book (in progress)
   
     Nice to have

     Matt Kenworthy has been working on web-izing
     the previous manuscript based on Tex/LaTeX.
     Work continues but the status re a 2.4.7
     release schedule is not known.


N  PDL::Constants

     Nice to have

     We've had mailing list discussions on this topic.
     All that needs to be done is the implementation.
     The idea is to use Readonly as the basis for the
     constants and, perhaps, have a 'use constant'
     fall back version.
   

N  Verify dependency detection across all major PDL platforms

     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)

     Needs multiple testers willing to check a clean
     build of each dependency on their platform and
     report what happens with and without dependency.

     Confirm that all dependencies for each platform
     are correctly detected and reported.  If there
     are issues, they should be in the Known_problems
     for platform specific information.


N  Alien modules for the external PDL dependencies
   * Alien::PLplot
   * Alien::PROJ4

     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)

     This is the first stage of getting PDL::Graphics::PLplot
     working cross-platform: be able to have the PLplot lib
     checked for or even installed as a dependency.  Work in
     Alien::SDL would be a good starting point here.


N  Define standard paths for external dependency libraries for PDL

     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)

     This is basically bookkeeping so that as the
     dependency issues are sorted out, we have a
     standard PDL-specific local install location
     for non-system library installs.


N  List and obtain module owners and developers for existing PDL modules

     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)

     Again, this is basically bookkeeping so that
     as the dependency issues are sorted out, we
     have a designated POC/maintainer for each
     PDL component.


N  Clean up build output from make process to reduce cruft
     
     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)


N  Check/set perldl.conf options before the PDL build?

     Nice to have (pushed to PDL-2.4.8)

     I think giving users an interactive option to set
     the perldl.conf values would be nice.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
D  Add docs/support for users of other non-PDL software

     Nice to have

     This has already been addressed.  Further
     improvements are always possible but we're
     probably good for 2.4.7 as we stand.


D  Clean up and triage for tickets prior to release.

     Required

     Only one critical bug left...done soon.


D  Fix the test problems with preexisting PDL installs

     Nice to have

     This would involve writing a routine to probe
     @INC for PDL (or maybe an arbitrary module) and
     reporting whether it was already installed.
     You would need to make sure not to pick up
     the blib version from the build process.


D  Add support for Known_problems to tests

     Required

     This is basically adding a SKIP section to tests
     that correspond to open sf.net bugs and conditionalize
     on the environment of the build.  Needed by release
     time to support user builds.


D  Fix PDL Config

     Required

     This is a reported bug at sf.net where the
     %PDL::Config hash is not updated from the
     results of the "have PDL check" options in
     the perldl.conf file.
