   'This world, where much is to be done and little to be known.' 
      - Samuel Johnson. Prayers and Meditations. Against inquisitive 
                        and perplexing Thoughts.

System
------

* Improve float() etc... memory management 

* Interface to mmap() ?

* overload array lookup with tie(...) ? (Does not
  seem compatible with use of hv_fetch()) etc.

* prototype some functions

* overload ops: . for some thing

* ***************** COMPLEX NUMBERS ******************

IO
---

* file mapping ?

* DSA writer/header handling

Functions
----------

* where (COND) {EXPR} - e.g. where ($x>42) { $x = 1/$x } ?

* select (COND) (PDL) - e.g. select ($x>42, $x) select values (output -> 1D)
  (i.e. shrinks PDL) ?

* sort ($x,$y,$z...) - 1D only

* FFT

* Grow list -> (N+1) Dim

* Transpose function

* Matrix inverse (via following:)

* linear system solver

* SVD algorithm

* Interpolation/rebinning 

* Projection - extend sum() e.g.: sum($x,1) for along Y axis - 
  also median($x,1)?

* easy extend($image,...) function ?


Graphics
--------

* Karma interface?

* Check outs AIPSVIEW

Minor
-----

* set/at/sec etc should be able to take negative indices to refer
  to from end. e.g. '-1' is the last element.

* remove perldl 'cmd # comment' bug - use perl_eval_sv in 5.003_01?

Always check
------------
  
* Fold in highlights of PDLmisc/ directory
