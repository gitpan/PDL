PDL Module Dependencies

This file lists dependencies of PDL modules on external programs/libraries.
Some of the modules will build ok without the external software but in
general are not very useful without it. Others require certain
libraries/ include files to be installed. See INSTALL on hints how to
disable building of some modules in the distrib if required.


MODULE          DEPENDS ON                  COMMENT

PDL (all)	perl 5.004_01		you need at least this version
					of perl to succeed.

perldl (shell)  Term::ReadLine    	perl provides a stub but if you
					compile and install a better one
					(Term::ReadLine or 
					Term::ReadLine::Gnu)

PDL::Graphics::TriD
                Requires OpenGL implementation. For free implementation
                check out Mesa at http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

                                        Required. Module won't build
                                        without libraries. To disable
                                        edit perldl.conf (see INSTALL).

PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
                PGPLOT perl module and PGPLOT fortran library,
                see http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot for the library
                and CPAN or http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/pgperl
                for the perl module

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        PGPLOT module and library

PDL::Graphics::IIS
                To be useful an application that supports the
                'IIS' protocol must be installed, e.g. SAOimage
                or Ximtool, see
                http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html
                http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/projects/x11iraf/x11iraf.html

                                        Builds without viewers.

PDL::Graphics::Karma
                Needs Karma visualisation library and tools.
                See http://www.atnf.csiro.au/karma. Binary distribs
                for many popular platforms available

                                        Module will only be built
                                        if library is installed on
                                        system.

PDL::IO::Pic     
                rpic/wpic: pbm+ or netpbm converters
                 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
                 and ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg for jpeg converter

                wmpeg: mpeg_encode program,
                  see ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/encode

                                        Module builds
                                        ok without converters

PDL::Lib::Slatec
                Slatec fortran lib is included but currently
                requires f2c to build. 

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        f2c is installed on your
                                        system.
