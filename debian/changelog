pdl (1:2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * delete bogus debian.orig directory

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Mar 2001 15:15:59 -0500

pdl (1:2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * new upstream release
  * turned off make test because it has problems:
      1. requires an active X session (bad for autobuilders), and
      2. requires slatec (or linfit fails).  [Can't support
         slatec until ExtUtils::F77 is a debian package]
  * bumped up urgency because old pdl doesn't support newest
    perl, and some people consider that serious.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 20:51:12 -0500

pdl (1:2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * reintroduced scantree.pl and mkhtmldoc to postinst (fixes
    problem reported in private email by Dav Clark and Gordon Haverland
    -- thanks).
  * note: this version won't purge cleanly, as it creates a couple
    files a postinst time which aren't removed even at purge time.
  * got rid of bashisms from debian/rules
  * translated /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc and /usr/man to /usr/share/man
  * never released -- ignore epoch

pdl (2.1.1-0pre1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * this is a pre-release, among other things, I'm waiting for xlib6g-dev
    to stabilize.  Please email me, personally, with any bug reports.
    This is not an official release.  Changes from the 2.1.1 sources on
    sourceforge for this prerelease:
      + chmod +x debian/rules
      + this entry in debian/changelog
      + editted copy of perldl.conf as debian/.perldl.conf (no -lMesa*)
      + HOME=`pwd`/debian added to Makefile.PL part of debian/rules

pdl (2.005-2) frozen; urgency=medium

  * Argh, forgot to fix t/gauss.t -- this is required
    for Bug#55268 to really be fixed.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Apr 2000 13:45:28 -0400

pdl (2.005-1) frozen; urgency=medium

  * new bugfix upstream version
  * two hacks:  (1) disable #ifdef in Basic/Math/mconf.h which includes 
    <nan.h> on our linux alpha, (2) disable test which shows that guassian 
    doesn't work properly on our linux alpha.  (Fixes Bug#55268)

pdl (2.003-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Nov 1999 07:16:55 -0500

pdl (2.002-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer
  * recreated source package, unpack in pdl-2.002 instead of PDL-2.002
    [this oddity in source package accounts for earlier diff problems].  
    (Fixes #45771).
  * do "make test" at build time
  * removed suggests jpeg-progs, I can't find any such package
  * removed suggests pgperl, there's a well labeled demo that fails
    and that should be enough of a suggestion for people who would want
    this non-free support.  If there's demand, and if special compilation
    support turns out to be needed, I supposed I'll have to create
    a pdl-nonfree...
